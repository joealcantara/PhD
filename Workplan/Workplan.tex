	\section{Interest Statement}
	I am interested in whether technology can be used to aid the early diagnosis of dementia specifically by analysing speech and language in a natural environment. As part of this, I am exploring the use of technologies such as the Amazon Echo or Google Home kit to capture speech and language. I am using Natural Language Processing to generate features from the captured speech such that we can categorise people into specific categories and/or predict test results on scores using machine learning.
	\section{Literature Review}
	\subsection{Dementia - Context}
	What is the Problem? 
	Why is this important?
	What is the potential impact?
	\subsection{How do Psychologists assess dementia}
	What tools do psychologists use to diagnose dementia? 
	Mini mental state examination (MMSE), 
	Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination(ACE-III)
	(WAIS?)
	\subsection{How do Psychologists understand how language is affected by dementia}
	What language deficits are there and how are they characterised?
	What speech deficits are there and how are they characterised?
	\subsection{How is Natural Language Processing best positioned to help in this area?}
	\subsection{Are there any other technologies that can be used to help diagnosis?}
	
	\subsection{What Research has been done in the area so far?}
	\subsection{Conclusion}
