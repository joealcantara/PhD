	\section{Overview of Problem}
	I am interested in whether technology can be used to aid the early diagnosis of dementia specifically by analysing speech and language in a natural environment. As part of this, I am exploring the use of technologies such as the Amazon Echo or Google Home kit to capture speech and language. I am using Natural Language Processing to generate features from the captured speech such that we can categorise people into specific categories and/or predict test results on scores using machine learning.
