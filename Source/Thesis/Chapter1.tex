\section{Introduction}
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease in which, from a physiological perspective, the brain develops neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques along with the deterioration and loss of cortical neurons and synapses. Whilst a definitive diagnosis of Dementia can only be produced at post-mortem, there are a number of clinical indicators from psychological perspective that can indicate dementia is present. From a clinical psychology perspective, those who have dementia demonstrate cognitive deficits such as problems with episodic and semantic memory, organizing and planning, difficulties with language, problems with executive function and visuospatial deficits \cite{McKhann2011}. In addition, these symptoms are often accompanied by emotional problems such as depression and behavioural difficulties. 
\par
AD and other forms of dementia affect a significant proportion of the geriatric population in the world today and is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the US and was named the leading killer of women in the UK. According to a recent report commissioned by the Alzheimer's Society in 2015, they estimate the prevalence of AD in the UK at approximately 815,000 people. This represents 1 in 14 of those aged 65 or over and 1 in 79 of the general population \cite{AlzheimersSociety2014}. From a financial perspective, they estimate an annual spend of £4.3 billion of which approximately £85 million is spent solely on diagnosis and that the total impact of AD (excluding the costs associated with early onset dementia) is £26.3 billion annually. Globally, this picture is a lot bleaker. Another report by Alzheimer's Disease International suggests that in 2015 there were 46 million people with a diagnosis of dementia globally and that number is expected to hit 131.5 million by 2050 \cite{Prince2015}. The report also states that the worldwide cost of AD in 2018 is estimated to be in the region of one trillon US dollars.
\par
Despite this growing problem, at present there are no drugs that improve the prognosis of those suffering with AD. All the drugs that are on the market are designed to manage symptoms. Whilst there are numerous investigational drugs in development for the treatment of AD, a larger than normal percentage (99.6\%) of these drugs fail in clinical trials (in contrast to anti-cancer drugs which have a 80\% failure rate) \cite{AlzheimersSociety2014}. Researchers have proposed that a possible reason for the lack of success is that the drugs treatments are initiated too far along in the progression of the disease and thus much of the degeneration of the brain has already taken place. It is therefore important to focus AD at it's earliest stages which some literature describes as 'Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD'.
\par
Current thinking suggests that the cognitive deficits associated with AD often begin before the clinical symptoms of the disease become apparent. Researchers propose that neurofibrillary tangles and other associated physiological effects of AD develop over time and alter cognitive function until a threshold is reached and clinical symptoms become more obvious \cite{Nestor2006}. The case of Iris Murdoch, who had a confirmed diagnosis of dementia, illustrates this theory well. Le et al \cite{Le2011} found, in their analysis of three writers and the novels they wrote, that Iris Murdoch's work declined subtly over time, but there was a steep drop off in the use of language in her last novel when, it is theorized, the symptoms of AD manifested themselves more significantly. If this theory holds true more generally, it should be possible to detect subtle cognitive changes in language and memory before a clinical diagnosis can be formed. One of the challenges of this approach is differentiating natural cognitive decline due to aging with decline due to a form of dementia. Albert and his team have worked to define clinical criteria which professionals can use to diagnose MCI due to AD and differentiate this from age-associated memory impairment and age-associated cognitive decline. They note that the diagnosis of MCI requires evidence of intra-individual change and optimally requires evaluation at two or more points \cite{Albert2011}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Concern regarding a change in cognition - A person or an informant should express concern that there is a change in cognitive ability in comparison to previous level of performance.
	\item Impairment in one or more cognitive domains - There should be evidence of lower performance in one or more cognitive domains beyond what would be expected of a person given their age and education. 
	\item Preservation of independence in functional - Whilst persons with MCI are expected to be able to maintain independence, it is common to experience mild problems in complex functional tasks which they may have been able to perform previously. This might mean that they take more time or be less efficient at completing these tasks, or it may be that may make more mistakes.
	\item Not demented - The deterioration should be mild to the point that there is no significant loss of functioning in social or occupational contexts.
\end{enumerate}
In addition to meeting the above criteria, a clinician must rule out other conditions or factors that could account for the decline in cognition with the goal to increase the likelihood that the underlying cause of this decline is dementia. 
\par 
Many researchers have studied the early detection of MCI. These studies usually follow two main approaches. The analysis of biomarkers and the examination of patients who have demonstrated decreasing cognitive abilities. The first approach yields reliable results in the detection of AD in its moderate and advanced states but does not perform well during the early stages of the disease. The second approach has gained more attention in recent years, due to the fact that in clinical practice it has shown promise in the early detection of AD. In addition, the analysis of the decline of cognitive abilities is comparatively inexpensive and less invasive that the first approach which commonly requires the collection of a sample of cerebro-spinal fluid which is painful for the patient involved. 
\par
One of the most common ways in which clinicians traditionally make an early diagnosis of dementia is through the use of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) \cite{Folstein1975}. The MMSE is a brief questionnaire consisting of eleven questions which tests cognitive aspects of mental function and requires only 5-10 minutes to administer \cite{Folstein1975}. The MMSE is chosen due to it's effectiveness at assessing a person's cognitive mental state at a specific point in time, as well as being as sensitive to changes as a more detailed and complex assessment such as the Wechler Adult Intelligence Scale \cite{Folstein1975}. Whilst the MMSE is useful as a brief screening tool it has it's limitations. The MMSE was not specifically created to screen for dementias and therefore does not interrogate key aspects of cognitive impairment known to be affected in dementia. It also has limited value in assessing under-educated subjects and a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of the MMSE as a diagnostic tool for dementia showed that it's accuracy was low (sensitivity between 78.4\% and 85.1\% and specificity between 81.3\% and 87.8\%). As the MMSE has been shown to have low accuracy specifically in the diagnosis of dementia, it becomes necessary for professionals to employ the use of other tools or measures such as the Free Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) \cite{Grober2010} or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) \cite{Davis2015}. 
\par 
These tests have the benefits of being much more accurate at diagnosing cognitive impairment and discriminating between dementia and other types of cognitive impairment at the cost time and training of psychological professionals such as clinical psychologists in administering these tests. However, the utility of diagnosing dementia at the point where clinical intervention is warranted is limited because at this stage both psychological and pharmacological interventions have been shown to not be effective \cite{Prince2015}. In order to further our understanding of the progression of dementia it is important to detect the signs of dementia before they are clinically apparent. 
\par
The two main ways in which diagnosis is performed is through assessment of memory and language. Tests of memory are classically among the most accurate ways of diagnosing dementia, however these tests suffer from the same reliance on clinicians to administer these tests in a clinical setting. Language however is a lot easier to collect and can be done in more naturalistic settings. As with memory, these tests can be done over time and would be able to chart a patients language degeneration over time. Given that language is less intrusive to test and requires a lot of the cognitive processes that may be impacted by AD, a lot of research has focused on measure decline in the use of language in those with AD. There are a number of difficulties to watch out for with this approach. There are a wide number of factors that are involved in language degeneration in the elderly, and consequently there will be an expected amount of variability between subjects. The administration of such tests may induce nervousness and discomfort which may impact performance, and also repeatedly administering the same language tests for differences over time may be confounded by improved performance at tasks via practice effects. However, there is enough promise in this approach such that it could help further our understanding of the disease, it's progression and the parts of the brain affected in the early stages.
\par
According to the DSM 5 \cite{AmericanPsychiatricAssociation2013}, those with mild dementia suffer from noticeable word finding difficulty. They may substitute general terms for more specific terms and may avoid the use of specific names of acquaintances. There may be grammatical errors involving subtle omission or incorrect use of articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, etc. Those who have progressed from Mild to Major depression also have difficulties with expressive or receptive language. They will often use general-use phrases such as "that thing" and "you know what I mean" and prefers general pronouns rather than names. With severe impairment, sufferers may not even recall names of closer friends and family. Idiosyncratic word usage, grammatical errors, and spontaneity of output and economy of utterances occur. Echolalia (meaningless repetition of another person's spoken words) and automatic speech typically precede mutism. With the wide range of deficits someone with AD can suffer, it makes sense to try to categorise these deficits in some way.
\par
One of the most famous pieces of research on the topic of language decline in dementia was by Berisha and Liss who examined speeches and public interviews of former US president Ronald Reagan \cite{Berisha2015}. They found that Reagan's speeches towards the end of his presidency suffered from difficulties in word-finding, inappropriate phrases and uncorrected sentences which are hallmarks of language deterioration associated with Alzheimer's Disease. It turned out later to be the case that he had Alzheimer's Disease. Another classical study by Snowdon et al looked at whether linguistic ability in early life was associated with cognitive function and AD in later life \cite{Snowdon1996} . They found that idea density (defined as the number of expressed propositions divided by the number of words) was a key predictor in predicting whether nuns would go on to develop AD in later life. They found that those who would go on to develop AD all had low idea density in early life and they found no AD present in those with high idea density in early life. As we can see, just with these two pieces of research the range of language deficits in those who suffer with AD are extremely variable and can differ from patient to patient as the disease progresses. The consensus among researchers that this language degeneration is typically accelerated by the presence of dementia \cite{Berisha2015} and that a potential indicator of dementia is the rate of change in which the decline occurs relative to a fixed point in time rather than a comparison across a cohort of individuals. 
\par
Emery \cite{Emery2000} completed a literature review looking at all the potential language deficits that could exist in those with AD and / or MCI. She divided these deficits into four levels of language: Phonology, Morphology, Syntax and Semantics. She proposed that language and the processes involved in language are hierarchical in nature and that language moves from simple units of construction (Phonology and Morphology), and build layers of complexity and sophistication (Syntax and Semantics). She found that people with AD generally had intact Phonology and Morphology but more impaired Syntax and Semantics. She asserted that the language forms we learn last are the first to deteriorate as we generally learn language in small simple units initially and build syntax and complexity as we are more comfortable with language. However it is important to note that different variants of dementia show different deficits in terms of language productions. Regardless, dividing language in this way is useful as it allows us to detect deteriorations in different parts of language usage and therefore may provide a way of discriminating between different forms of dementia. 
\par
It is clear from both the clinical diagnostic criteria and supporting research that language is impacted in those with AD. However, whilst there is a move towards research aimed at looking more specifically at MCI we currently lack the measures that are sensitive enough to detect MCI. Given that we know language is affected before a clinical diagnosis of dementia is usually made \cite{Berisha2015, Snowdon1996, Le2011}, it makes sense to explore whether language on it's own can provide markers that may indicate a cognitive impairment that could progress to dementia. The field of machine learning and natural language processing has been suggested as a way to improve the accuracy and lessen the human cost of this research as well as provide new insights into the difficulties that AD suffer in terms of language decline \cite{Boschi2017}.
\par 
In 2009, the UK's Department of Health designed it's National Dementia strategy and as part of this made early diagnosis and support one of it's key priorities \cite{England2009}. A lot of work has gone into trying to find ways of improving the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) with research focused on two areas - identifying biological markers and analyzing the cognitive decline of those who are suspected to have the disease \cite{Taler2008}. As described above, the numbers of those suffering from AD and MCI are going to increase as the population ages \cite{Prince2015} and thus it is important that we utilize technology wherever possible to aid clinicians in the detection of MCI and AD. At the present time diagnostic assessment is typically conducted at memory clinics by trained clinicians \cite{Boschi2017} and whilst it is not possible to provide a definitive diagnosis until after death. 

I theorize that we may be able to enable an earlier diagnosis of those with MCI and AD using samples of spontaneous speech, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).
\par
There is a large body of research that looks at the decline in language in those with MCI and AD \cite{Taler2008, Boschi2017}. However there is conflicting evidence in these studies about which declining language factors are associated of MCI and AD \cite{Taler2008, Boschi2017}. Research therefore should look at these features in more detail and a clarification of this currently disorganised picture should go some way to helping researchers further understand the disease and it's progression. Another area of focus for research of this nature is the process of collecting appropriate language samples. Whilst collecting samples of language is comparatively unintrusive, researchers recognise that these samples require a rich sample of language that potentially cannot be generated by tasks such as the picture description task. Therefore, it would be useful to explore whether spontaneous discourse such a semi-structured interview, has the ability to put pressure on both the cognitive and linguistic systems in the same way as traditional cognitive tests such that it might be able to distinguish between healthy controls, those with MCI and those with AD. There is some evidence to support this. Berisha et al \cite{Berisha2015}, has shown through a longitudinal language analysis of spontaneous speech that there are marked differences in this process between those who would go on to have a diagnosis of AD and a healthy control. 
\par
The potential impact of this research in this area is immense. Research has shown that early diagnosis of people with AD or MCI improves sufferers quality of life and can, in some cases, slow the progress of the disease. Early diagnosis can increase the number of research opportunities for understanding the early stages of dementia and how the disease progresses so that more research can be conducted which may, in the future, lead to new treatments and other interventions.

Finally, in chapter 8. I discuss conduct a general discussion of the results of my research. I also think about the strengths and weaknesses of my work and suggest ways in which the research have been improved. Lastly, I look at a number of areas for future work which can build on this research.
