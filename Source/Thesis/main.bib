abstract = {The theme of this paper is to study the effect of Miller type loading on a conventional transmission line with non-linear elements, capacitor and inductor. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the use of non-linear elements, like varactor diodes or variable capacitor or an inductor on iron core material in the transmission line model in Miller form to produce negative group delay. The reason for choosing the Miller form loading is the practical simplicity of realizing these transmission line models on microstrip. Two different types of loadings are considered in this paper, one with the non-linear capacitor and other with the non-linear inductor. The gain for a unit cell of this model is obtained and the group delay and phase delay has been analyzed. After the analysis, is observed that the non-linear elements can produce the opposite delays in the circuit models. {\textcopyright} Research India Publications.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyse the reliability of sentinel-node biopsy (SNB) in a multicentre setting and define conditions for the routine use of the procedure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIAL AND METHODS: SNB with consecutive axillary clearing was performed in 1124 breast cancer patients. The detection rate of a sentinel lymph node and its dependence on the choice of lymphography technique, patient selection, and technical procedure were analysed. The diagnostic performance of the sentinel-node method was compared to clinical, ultrasound-guided and histological staging. In order to study training effects all learning periods were included.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Twenty-two institutions with a total of 89 surgeons participated in the trial. The detection rate (overall: 85.2{\%}) was found to be related to the applied lymphography technique, the experience of the institution and various technical factors of the procedure itself. The false-negative rate (FNR, overall: 8.2{\%}) was independent of patient selection and technical features. The FNR did not depend on experience in the application of the method, but seemed related to surgical accuracy to detect sentinel nodes. Compared to conventional staging procedures (palpation, ultrasound) SNB yielded highly reproducible results for the prediction of the axillary status even in a multicentre setting involving surgeons with different training status.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: SNB is suited as standard of care procedure. Measures of quality control appear more important than learning periods to minimize the FNR.},

Our results support the hypothesis that signs of dementia can be found in diachronic analyses of patients' writings, and in addition lead to new understanding of the work of the individual authors whom we studied. In particular, we show that it is probable that Agatha Christie indeed suffered from the onset of Alzheimer's while writing her last novels, and that Iris Murdoch exhibited a ‘trough' of relatively impoverished vocabulary and syntax in her writing in her late 40s and 50s that presaged her later dementia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if linguistic ability in early life is associated with cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease in late life. DESIGN: Two measures of linguistic ability in early life, idea density and grammatical complexity, were derived from autobiographies written at a mean age of 22 years. Approximately 58 years later, the women who wrote these autobiographies participated in an assessment of cognitive function, and those who subsequently died were evaluated neuropathologically. SETTING: Convents in the United States participating in the Nun Study; primarily convents in the Milwaukee, Wis, area. PARTICIPANTS: Cognitive function was investigated in 93 participants who were aged 75 to 95 years at the time of their assessments, and Alzheimer's disease was investigated in the 14 participants who died at 79 to 96 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seven neuropsychological tests and neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Low idea density and low grammatical complexity in autobiographies written in early life were associated with low cognitive test scores in late life. Low idea density in early life had stronger and more consistent associations with poor cognitive function than did low grammatical complexity. Among the 14 sisters who died, neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease was present in all of those with low idea density in early life and in none of those with high idea density. CONCLUSIONS: Low linguistic ability in early life was a strong predictor of poor cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease in late life.},

abstract = {Language assessment has a crucial role in the clinical diagnosis of several neurodegenerative diseases. The analysis of extended speech production is a precious source of information encompassing the phonetic, phonological, lexico-semantic, morpho-syntactic, and pragmatic levels of language organization. The knowledge about the distinctive linguistic variables identifying language deficits associated to different neurodegenerative diseases has progressively improved in the last years. However, the heterogeneity of such variables and of the way they are measured and classified limits any generalization and makes the comparison among studies difficult. Here we present an exhaustive review of the studies focusing on the linguistic variables derived from the analysis of connected speech samples, with the aim of characterizing the language disorders of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including primary progressive aphasia, Alzheimer's disease, movement disorders, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A total of 61 studies have been included, considering only those reporting group analysis and comparisons with a group of healthy persons. This review first analyzes the differences in the tasks used to elicit connected speech, namely picture description, story narration, and interview, considering the possible different contributions to the assessment of different linguistic domains. This is followed by an analysis of the terminologies and of the methods of measurements of the variables, indicating the need for harmonization and standardization. The final section reviews the linguistic domains affected by each different neurodegenerative disease, indicating the variables most consistently impaired at each level and suggesting the key variables helping in the differential diagnosis among diseases. While a large amount of valuable information is already available, the review highlights the need of further work, including the development of automated methods, to take advantage of the richness of connected speech analysis for both research and clinical purposes.},

abstract = {Objective: Progressive memory impairment is the primary cognitive feature of Alzheimer's disease. Systematic attention to progressive language impair-ment is under-appreciated. The purpose of this article is to apply the semiotic language framework to organize the disparate findings on language impairment in DAT. Method: The semiotic system is hierarchical, going from simple to more complex units of language, with the hierarchical ranks of phonol-ogy, morphology, syntax, semantics. This language hierarchy is used as an organizing tool to provide a context for the discrete data on language decline in DAT. Studies relating to language impairment in DAT were identified through an exhaustive computerized search (Medline and Psych Info Database) of available literature spanning the last forty years in which 615 references were examined. Papers were selected for review if reference were made to any one or more of the language parameters of phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, or to any components or indicators of these parameters, such as sound production, naming, grammar, sentence processing, verbal comprehen-sion in Alzheimer patients. Results: There appears to be an overall relation between language decline and complexity of language both across and within the hierarchical ranks. There also appears to be an associated negative relation between sequence in language development and language decline. Language forms learned last in the sequence of language development are the most complex and appear to be first to deteriorate. Conclusions: The decline of language in DAT appears to be hierarchical in nature. Further understand-ing of this hierarchical language decline depends in part on nosologic clarification and subtyping of DAT.},
