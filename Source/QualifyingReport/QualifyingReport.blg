 :  abstract = {English texts were constructed from propositional bases. One set of 16-$\backslash$nword sentences was obtained from semantic bases containing from 4 to 9$\backslash$nproposition;. For another set of sentences and paragraphs, number of words$\backslash$nand number of propositions covaried. Subjects read the texts at their own$\backslash$nrate and recalled them immediately. For the 16-word sentences, subjects$\backslash$nneeded 1.5 set additional reading time to process each proposition. For$\backslash$nlonger texts, this value increased. In another experimental condition reading$\backslash$ntime was controlled by the experimenter. The analysis of both the text$\backslash$nand the recall protocols in terms of number of propositions lent support to$\backslash$nthe notion that propositions are a basic unit of memory for text. However,$\backslash$nevidence was also obtained that while the total number of propositions upon$\backslash$nwhich a text was based proved to be an effective psychological variable, all$\backslash$npropositions were not equally difficult to remember: superordinate propositions$\backslash$nwere recalled better than propositions which were stucturally subordinate.$\backslash$nConsiderable experimental evidence exists today indicating that sentences,$\backslash$nand prose material in general, are not stored in memory verbatim,$\backslash$nbut are coded as to their content (Sachs, 1967; Bransford {\&} Franks, 1971;$\backslash$nKintsch {\&} Monk, 1972). While such findings agree very well with our$\backslash$nintuitions, they do not help us determine precisely in what way content$\backslash$nis coded in memory. Since the general problem is extremely complex,$\backslash$nno general theory of text memory has yet been formulated. Such a theory$\backslash$nwould be required to consider numerous properties of a text. For example,$\backslash$na sentence presents some new information in a given context,$\backslash$nsituational or verbal; a part of a sentence or paragraph must be identified$\backslash$nas the theme; there are grammatical relations among the elements of$\backslash$na sentence; and finally, each text has a logical structure. It is only this$\backslash$nlatter, ideational function of language that the present paper shall be$\backslash$nâ€˜This research was supported by a Grant from the National Institute of Mental$\backslash$nHealth, MH-15872.

Textual and communicative aspects will be neglected,$\backslash$neven though they are undoubtedly of great psycholinguistic significance.$\backslash$nA number of theories have recently been developed concerning the$\backslash$nlogical structure of text and, closely related, the nature of semantic memory.$\backslash$nSeveral linguists have explored the idea that sentences have a base$\backslash$nstructure consisting of propositions which represent their semantic content.$\backslash$nKintsch (1972) has shown how one could conceive of semantic$\backslash$nmemory as being constructed from such propositional expressions. In the$\backslash$npresent paper an attempt is made to show that the propositional base$\backslash$nstructure of a sentence, as postulated by Kintsch ( 1972), has predictable$\backslash$nempirical effects upon behavior. Such a demonstration is of crucial$\backslash$nimportance if the speculations that have been offered about semantic$\backslash$nmemory are to be taken seriously as a psychological model.$\backslash$nThis initial experiment was designed to determine whether the number$\backslash$nof propositions in the base structure of a sentence is an important$\backslash$npsychological variable. In particular, sentences which differed in the$\backslash$nnumber of underlying propositions, but which were equal in terms of total$\backslash$nnumber of words, were given to subjects to read and to recall immediately$\backslash$nafter reading. A second set of sentences and paragraphs, in which number$\backslash$nof words and number of propositions covaried, was also used in order$\backslash$nto study number of propositions over a wider range. With the number of$\backslash$nwords per sentence controlled, propositions varied from 4 to 9; with$\backslash$nthe second set of sentences propositions varied from 2 to 23. If number$\backslash$nof propositions is an effective psychological variable, reading time should$\backslash$nincrease as more propositions are processed; likewise, the number of$\backslash$npropositions subjects are able to recall should be related to processing$\backslash$ntime in a lawful way. Of course, by averaging over all kinds of different$\backslash$npropositions and looking only at the effect of the total number of$\backslash$npropositions, many potentially significant sources of variance are being$\backslash$nneglected. In addition to the mere number of propositions, the nature$\backslash$nand number of their arguments, their complexity, structural relations$\backslash$namong them, lexical factors, and many other properties might be important$\backslash$ndeterminants of reading speed and comprehensibility. In$\backslash$nthe studies reported here, a11 of these factors vary unsystematically. Thus,$\backslash$nthe difficulty that each proposition presents is certainly not a constant,$\backslash$nbut a random variable with an appreciable variance. Nevertheless, as$\backslash$nlong as one deals with averages, the number of propositions upon which$\backslash$na text is based should have a strong and significant effect, if the proposition$\backslash$nis indeed a proper unit of analysis for studies concerned with the$\backslash$nprocessing and storage of linguistic information.$\backslash$nSome subjects were allowed to study each sentence or paragraph as$\backslash$nlong as they wanted; their reading time was one of the major dependent$\backslash$nPROPOSITIONAL BASE AND READING 259$\backslash$nvariables of interest for the present study. Other subjects, however, were$\backslash$ngiven only a limited reading time. Their recall was compared with that$\backslash$nof unrestricted subjects, and a processing model that captures some of$\backslash$nthe most salient features of both sets of data was developed.$\backslash$nMETHOD$\backslash$nSubjects. In the free reading time condition, 29 undergraduates from$\backslash$nthe University of Colorado served as subjects. They were fulfilling part$\backslash$nof a course requirement. For the restricted reading time condition, 44$\backslash$nstudents were each paid {\$}2.00 for their participation.\backslashnMaterial. Two sets of materials were constructed for this experiment.\backslashnSet A consisted of 10 sentences which were 16-17 words long counting\backslashnpunctuation, 1616 otherwise. The sentences were not related to each\backslashnother, most of them dealing with topics from classical history. This choice\backslashnof topics was made in an attempt to hold the relative familarity of the\backslashntext at a minimum, while avoiding problems of vocabulary concomitant\backslashnwith equally unfamiliar but more technical material.\backslashnAlthough word length in these sentences was fairly strictly controlled,\backslashnthe number of propositions upon which each sentence was based varied\backslashnbetween four and nine. Two sample sentences, together with the propositions\backslashnfrom which they were constructed and the hierarchical relationships\backslashnwhich exist among these propositions, are shown in Table 1. The analysis\backslashninto propositions was made according to the theory described in Kintsch\backslashnTABLE 1\backslashnVIII.

Briefly, each proposition consists of a relational term (written\backslashnfirst) and one or more arguments. Propositions may themselves appear\backslashnas arguments of other propositions, in which case Greek letters were used\backslashnin order to avoid overly complex expressions. The analysis used here\backslashndiffers from that proposed earlier (Kintsch, 1972) in only one minor\backslashnrespect: the restriction that verbs may not be used as arguments in\backslashnpropositions has been dropped; this led to some considerable simplifications\backslashnin the obtained expressions. Propositions have been numbered\backslashnsolely for the purpose of identification in the graphs showing the hierarchical\backslashnrelations among them. As described in Kintsch (1972), these\backslashnhierarchical relations are implicit in the order in which propositions are\backslashnwritten: a proposition /3 is subordinated to another proposition (Y if (Y precedes\backslashnp in the list of propositions and if (Y and ,8 have at least one term\backslashn(relation or argument) in common.\backslashnOne of the major problems in work of this type is that no algorithmic\backslashnprocedure exists to analyze a given sentence (or paragraph) into its\backslashnpropositional base structure. However, for present purposes the problem\backslashncan be circumvented in the following way: one can start with the\backslashnpropositional expressions themselves and translate these into English\backslashntext. The rules for doing so are simpler and are somewhat better\backslashnunderstood, although they do not really exist in explicit form either.\backslashnAt least very substantial agreement could be obtained that the\backslashnsentences used are indeed one way to express the meaning of the coordinated\backslashnpropositions.\backslashnSet B consisted of 20 sentences or paragraphs in which the number\backslashnof underlying propositions and the number of words were confounded.\backslashnThe shortest sentence contained seven words in two propositions; the\backslashnlongest paragraphs were based upon 22 propositions, requiring 58 words,\backslashnand 23 propositions, requiring 45 words, All sentences in Set B were\backslashndefinitions and descriptions of psychological terms, modified from the\backslashnglossaries of several psychological texts, and thus, dealt with relatively\backslashnunfamiliar topics.\backslashnProcedure--free reading. Slides were made for all sentences and paragraphs.\backslashnThe subject was seated about 3 m in front of a screen on which\backslashnthe slides were shown by means of a Kodak Carousel projector. The\backslashnexperimenter, who was seated behind the subject, exposed a slide\backslashnand simultaneously started a Hunter Timer. In front of the subject\backslashnthere was a box with two labeled response buttons: an Advance slide\backslashnbutton and a Finish button. The subject was instructed to read the sentenc},
