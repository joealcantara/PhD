\section{Aims and Objectives}
According to a recent report commissioned by the Alzheimer's Society in 2015, they estimate the prevalence of Dementia in the UK at approximately 815,000 people. This represents 1 in 14 of the population aged 65 or over and 1 in 79 in the general population. This report also estimates an annual healthcare spend on £4.3 billion of which approximately £85 million is spend solely on diagnosis. They also estimate that the overall impact of dementia (excluding the costs associated with early onset dementia) is £26.3 billion annually. Globally, this picture is a lot bleaker. A recent report suggests that in 2015 there were 46 million people with a diagnosis of dementia and that number is expected to hit 131.5 million by 2050 \cite{Prince2015}. The report also states that the worldwide cost of dementia in 2018 is estimated to be in the region of one trillon US dollars. \newline
