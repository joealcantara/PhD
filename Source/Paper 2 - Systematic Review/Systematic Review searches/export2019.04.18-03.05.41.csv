As a well-known early symptom, some linguistic complexity changes of language have been associated with the progression of AD. Currently, the investigations of linguistic manifestations of MCI do mostly rely on manual analysis, yet linguistic complexity-based neuropsychological assessment cannot be effectively attained by using manual approaches. Taking advantage of the existing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key features in linguistic complexity changes associated with the progression of MCI, this study develops an NLP-oriented computerized neuropsychological assessment to automatically analyze the distinguishing characteristics of data in the MCI group versus those in cognitively normal control (CN) group. By using the transcripts of news conferences from President Ronald Reagan, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower (DE), and President George H. W. Bush (GB), who have no known diagnosis of AD, this study found the significantly different patterns of the linguistic complexity changes between CN and MCI subjects, which can be applied into the diagnosis of MCI.","","978-1-5090-3050-7978-1-5090-3051","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217706","feature extraction;text mining;natural language processing;computerized neuropsychological assessment;mild cognitive impairment;linguistic complexity","Pragmatics;Feature extraction;Complexity theory;Market research;Natural language processing;Dementia","cognition;computational complexity;diseases;feature extraction;medical computing;natural language processing;neurophysiology;patient treatment","computerized neuropsychological assessment;mild cognitive impairment;feature extraction;neuropsychological testing;Alzheimer's disease;linguistic complexity changes;linguistic manifestations;natural language processing;cognitively normal control group;MCI group","","1","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VANET is a special ad-hoc network that equips vehicles with wireless communication devices. Hence vehicles can talk with Road side unit (RSU) and the traffic information can be shared among them. This work improves algorithm is to improve the reliability of safety message transmission and to control the road accident. Prediction algorithm methods used are Spatial Correlation Mining, Temporal Correlation Mining, and Historical Spectrum Sensing Data Mining(HSS). All vehicles share hidden channel state transition model in statistic. Using Hidden Markov Model(HMM), the relationship between observations and hidden channel states are estimated, and characterized the channel state transition rule among sequential spectrum sensing decisions. The correlation among spectrum sensing data from different vehicles is called spatial correlation and Dirichlet Process(DP) is used to model this property. HSS prediction algorithm is used to pick out the channel with the greatest probability of availability. This can efficiently avoid harmful interference to PUs and reduce transmission delay of urgent safety message applications.","","978-1-5386-0807-4978-1-5386-0806-7978-1-5386-0808","10.1109/ICISC.2018.8398979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8398979","Vehicular ad-hoc networks;Cognitive radio;Channel availability prediction;Spectrum sensing;Data mining","Sensors;Hidden Markov models;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Correlation;Cognitive radio;Data mining","cognitive radio;data mining;hidden Markov models;radio spectrum management;radio transceivers;road accidents;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless channels","cognitive radio;ad-hoc network;road side unit;hidden Markov model;spatial correlation mining;temporal correlation mining;historical spectrum sensing data mining;safety message applications;CR enabled VANET;road accident control;Dirichlet process;transmission delay;HSS prediction algorithm;sequential spectrum sensing decisions;channel state transition rule;hidden channel states;hidden channel state transition model;prediction algorithm methods;safety message transmission;traffic information;wireless communication devices;wireless spectrum;wireless channels;intelligent radio transceiver;safety-message delivery;energy detection","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have a high prevalence among the elderly. Early diagnosis of AD allows early treatment and improves patient's quality of life. In this paper, we propose a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to aid physicians in diagnosis of AD and related disorders: Dementia (D) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). For each case, the system exhibits the most probable diagnosis, the most relevant health records and unobserved health records that could confirm such diagnosis. Moreover, the system has the ability to refine its decision model using the final diagnosis reported by physicians. The system can offer to physicians a friendly user interface designed for smartphones. The proposed decision support system is flexible and adaptable to different contexts, since it allows new neuropsychological tests to be included and its decision model to be adapted automatically. Clinical cases from Center for Alzheimer's Disease (CAD) of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) were used as the training dataset for the proposed supervised learning method. Preliminary tests using clinical cases from Antônio Pedro University Hospital (HUAP) of Fluminense Federal University (UFF) showed that the proposed CDSS decision model achieves good performance (accuracy of 0.94 for D and 0.85 for MCI) by a computational method that evaluates several classifiers and selects the best for each mental disorder.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6014-6978-1-5090-6015","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489084","Clinical Decision Support Systems;Computeraided diagnosis;predictive models;Alzheimer’s disease","Dementia;Adaptation models;Data models;Training;Computational modeling","cognition;decision support systems;diseases;geriatrics;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical information systems;neurophysiology;user interfaces","clinical cases;CDSS decision model;aiding diagnosis;Alzheimer's Disease;adaptable decision model;public health systems;neurodegenerative diseases;early diagnosis;early treatment;clinical decision support system;physicians;Mild Cognitive Impairment;probable diagnosis;relevant health records;unobserved health records;final diagnosis;CAD;Federal University of Rio de Janeiro;UFRJ;Antônio Pedro University Hospital;HUAP;Fluminense Federal University;UFF;mental disorder","","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and repeatable technique to diagnose brain abnormalities. However, the analysis of EEG spectra is still carried out manually by experts and effective computer science methods to extract relevant information from these signals become a necessity. Through a data mining approach, which guides the automated knowledge discovery process, we aim to achieve an automatic patients classification from the EEG biomedical signals of AD and MCI, in order to support medical doctors in the diagnosis formulation. Specifically, we design an integrated procedure that encompasses the following steps: (1) data collection; (2) data preprocessing of EEG-signals data; (3) features extraction by applying time-frequency transforms on EEG-signals (Fourier and Wavelet analysis); and (3) a supervised learning approach to classify samples in patients suffering from AD, patients affected by MCI, and healthy control (HC) subjects. By applying our procedure, we are able to extract human-interpretable classification models that allow to automatically assign the patients into their belonging class. In particular, by exploiting a Wavelet feature extraction we achieve 83%, 92%, and 79% of accuracy when dealing with HC vs AD, HC vs MCI, and MCI vs AD classification problems, respectively. By comparing the classification performances with both feature extraction methods, we find out that Wavelets analysis outperforms Fourier. Thus, we suggest it in combination with supervised methods for automatic patients classification based on their EEG signals for aiding the medical diagnosis of dementia.

Hence, we introduce cognitive radio (CR) enabled VANET (CR-VANET), where CR device can detect possible idle spectrum for VANET communications and assist to timely broadcast safety-message. Given high-speed mobility of vehicles and dynamically-changing availability of channels, a novel prediction algorithm is proposed to pick out the channel with the greatest probability of availability, which can meet the quality of service (QoS) requirement of urgent communications and effectively avoid conflict with licensed users. Specifically, the spatiotemporal correlations among historical spectrum sensing data are exploited to form prior knowledge of channel availability probability, and Bayesian inference is used to derive posterior probability of channel availability. Comparing with other spectrum detection methods, the proposed algorithm has more than 8 percent detection performance improvement at false alarm probability 0.2, and thus can avoid access conflict with licensed users dramatically. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm always has larger packet reception probability (PRP) and lower transmission delay compared with conventional VANET broadcasting.

In this paper, we present an initial result of an effort to develop a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) system for the diagnosis of malaria. Concepts and their causality were defined based on the experiential knowledge from 30 physicians in 3 hospitals in Nigeria, who served as knowledge sources for this study. The semantic relationships among concepts were utilized in constructing an FCM model for malaria diagnosis, which was further integrated into a decision support engine (DSE). The comparative summary showed that the initial hypotheses (IH) by the physicians correctly matched the final diagnosis in 55% of the cases, whereas the accurate diagnosis (AD) of the FCM was 85%. This result is interesting; further analysis using Kendall's tau_b and the Spearman's rank order test also indicated a higher (though equally significant) correlation between the FCM results and AD than between IH and AD.

These attacks are sufficiently intense to affect the daily social and professional lives of patients. Today, in the absence of a reliable diagnosis and effective curative treatments, fighting this disease is becoming a real public health issue, prompting research to consider non-drug techniques. Among these techniques, speech processing is proving to be a relevant and innovative field of investigation. Several Machine Learning algorithms achieved promising results in distinguishing AD from healthy control subjects. Alternatively, many other factors such as feature extraction, the number of attributes for feature selection, used classifiers, may affect the prediction accuracy evaluation. To surmount these weaknesses, a model is suggested which include a feature extraction step followed by imperative attribute selection and classification is achieved using a machine learning classifiers.

In the proposed method, a dissimilarity matrix is constructed by estimating the coupling strength between every pair of EEG signals, Hierarchical clustering is then applied to group the related electrodes according to the dissimilarity estimated on pairs of EEG recordings. Subsequently, the connectivity density of the electrodes network is calculated. The technique was tested over two different coupling strength descriptors: wavelet coherence (WC) and permutation Jaccard distance (PJD), a novel metric of coupling strength between time series introduced in this paper. Twenty-five MCI patients were enrolled within a follow-up program that consisted of two successive evaluations, at time T0 and at time T1, three months later. At T1, four subjects were diagnosed to have converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When applying the PJD-based method, the converted patients exhibited a significantly increased PJD (p <; 0.05), i.e., a reduced overall coupling strength, specifically in delta and theta bands and in the overall range (0.5-32 Hz). In addition, in contrast to stable MCI patients, converted patients exhibited a network density reduction in every subband (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). When WC was used as coupling strength descriptor, the method resulted in a less sensitive and specific outcome. The proposed method, mixing nonlinear analysis to a machine learning approach, appears to provide an objective evaluation of the connectivity density modifications associated to the MCI-AD conversion, just processing noninvasive EEG signals.","2162-237X;2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2791644","Italian Ministry of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281011","Alzheimer’s Disease (AD);brain connectivity;electroencephalographic (EEG);hierarchical clustering (HC);mild cognitive impairment (MCI);network density;permutation entropy (PE);permutation Jaccard distance (PJD)","Electroencephalography;Couplings;Dementia;Coherence;Optical wavelength conversion;Complexity theory","diseases;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neurophysiology;time series","electrodes network;wavelet coherence;time series;PJD-based method;network density reduction;coupling strength descriptor;connectivity density modifications;MCI-AD conversion;EEG network density modifications;electroencephalographic-based method;EEG signals;EEG recordings;Alzheimer's disease;machine learning approach;dissimilarity matrix;mild cognitive impaired subjects;brain-electrical connectivity changes;permutation Jaccard distance-based hierarchical clustering;time 3.0 month;frequency 0.5 Hz to 32.0 Hz","","","64","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we cast extractive speech summarization as an ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) problem and investigate various language modeling (LM) methods for important sentence selection. The main contributions of this paper are four-fold. First, we explore a novel sentence modeling paradigm built on top of the notion of relevance, where the relationship between a candidate summary sentence and a spoken document to be summarized is discovered through different granularities of context for relevance modeling. Second, not only lexical but also topical cues inherent in the spoken document are exploited for sentence modeling. Third, we propose a novel clarity measure for use in important sentence selection, which can help quantify the thematic specificity of each individual sentence that is deemed to be a crucial indicator orthogonal to the relevance measure provided by the LM-based methods. Fourth, in an attempt to lessen summarization performance degradation caused by imperfect speech recognition, we investigate making use of different levels of index features for LM-based sentence modeling, including words, subword-level units, and their combination. Experiments on broadcast news summarization seem to demonstrate the performance merits of our methods when compared to several existing well-developed and/or state-of-the-art methods.","2329-9290;2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2015.2414820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063924","Clarity measure;KL divergence;language modeling;relevance modeling;speech summarization","Speech;Speech recognition;Semantics;Context modeling;Speech processing;Vectors;IEEE transactions","feature selection;information retrieval;natural language processing;speech processing;text analysis","relevance language modelling;LM;clarity measure;extractive speech summarization;information retrieval;IR;sentence selection","","10","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose a decision supporting model based on deep learning and machine learning to predict the conversion probability from MCI into AD within one year. We analyzed 165 samples with MRI scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, in which all MCI patients were converted into AD in different time span for conversion. In this model, we first extracted image features based on convolutional neural network (CNN) method, and then we used support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify these features. The results showed that the classification accuracy using linear, polynomial and RBF kernel could achieve 91.0%, 90.0% and 92.3%.

Such smart home environments can monitor and interact with patients and their doctors/caregivers to augment patient medical data for diagnosis than can be generated via traditional doctor visits. Moreover, smart homes are enabling older adults to stay at home longer as opposed to permanent moves to assisted living or nursing facilities, increasing health and well-being and decreasing overall costs to the individual and society at large. This paper proposes Cognitive Assisted Living (CAL), a cyber-physical system comprising a network of embedded devices for collecting and analyzing patient speech patterns over time for monitoring cognitive function beginning in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, CAL will analyze patient speech patterns and spatial abilities, via a set of daily interactions, to provide a longitudinal analysis of speech deterioration, a significant indicator of cognitive decline resulting from Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the rate of cognitive decline can enable caregivers and health care professionals to better manage the patient's daily care and medical requirements. Additionally, the patient's cognitive state can be shared across household devices to increase the patient's comfort and better accommodate lifestyle changes. To these ends, we describe the architecture of the proposed system, the methods to which we will detect cognitive decline, and specify how the system will provide continuing fault tolerance and data security at run time.","2575-8411","978-1-5386-6871-9978-1-5386-6872","10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8416418","smart home;multi-agent systems;cyber-physical systems;health care;software engineering","Dementia;Monitoring;Smart homes;Biomedical monitoring;Natural language processing","assisted living;cognition;cyber-physical systems;diseases;geriatrics;medical diagnostic computing;medical signal processing;patient care;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;speech processing;telemedicine","patient medical data;cyber-physical system;embedded devices;patient speech patterns;cognitive function;Alzheimer's disease;smart home environment;aging population;in-home support;cognitive decline monitoring;cognitive assisted living;health care technologies;speech deterioration analysis","","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address that problem, in this paper we propose a novel connectivity-network-based framework to fuse multiple properties of network features for MCI classification. Specifically, two different types of network features (i.e., Brain region and sub graph) are respectively used to quantify two different properties of networks, where two kinds of feature selection methods are further performed to remove the irrelevant and redundant features. Then, multi-kernel learning technique is adopted on those corresponding selected features to obtain the final classification results. We evaluate our proposed method on a real MCI dataset containing 12 MCI patients and 25 healthy controls. The experimental results show that by using multiple properties of network features our method achieves better performance than traditional methods using only single property of network features.","2375-9232;2375-9259","978-1-4799-4274-9978-1-4799-4275","10.1109/ICDMW.2014.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7022705","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI);Brain connectivity network;Subgraph;Multiple features","Kernel;Feature extraction;Educational institutions;Diseases;Support vector machines;Computer science;Electronic mail","brain;cognition;diseases;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);neurophysiology;patient diagnosis","multiple network features;mild cognitive impairment classification;connectivity-network-based techniques;Alzheimer's disease diagnosis;topological information;connectivity-network-based framework;MCI classification;feature selection methods;multikernel learning technique;MCI dataset;MCI patients","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There exist limitations in identifying more diverse variations that can happen in the real world due to the lack of considerations on daily human lives. As a novel solution, in this paper, we address a natural language processing (NLP) combined Web mining approach. Especially, we propose an object-activity-location-feedback (OALF) model which describes what objects are used for a specific activity in a specific location. Most of all, time variant feedback valences were employed to estimate users' responses to the advertisement triggering entities (objects, activities, locations, and their combinations) in terms of long-term and short-term basis. The model can be realized with a set of web mining procedures including web crawling, data refinement, and sentiment analysis. In addition, we describe how the OALF model can be applied into context-aware mobile advertising and discuss its business model design issues.","","978-1-4244-3923-2978-1-4244-3924","10.1109/INMW.2009.5195962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5195962","Web Mining;Feedback;Object;Activity;Location;Mobile Context-Aware Advertising System;and Architecture","Web mining;Context modeling;Advertising;Context-aware services;Feedback;Humans;Web pages;Natural language processing;Electronic mail;Prototypes","advertising;data mining;natural language processing;pattern matching;ubiquitous computing","Web mining based OALF model;Web mining based object activity location feedback model;context aware mobile advertising system;natural language processing;NLP;time variant feedback;business model design issue","","2","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our proposed predictive analysis framework extracts multi-dimensional temporal patterns from the content of advertisement videos using multimedia signal processing and natural language processing tools. The pattern analysis part employs an architecture of cross modality feature learning where data streams from different feature dimensions are employed to train separate neural network models and then these models are fused together to learn a shared representation. Subsequently, a neural network model trained on this joint representation is utilized as a classifier for predicting advertisement effectiveness. Based on the predictive patterns identified between the content features and the effectiveness metrics of advertisements, we have elicited a useful set of auditory, visual and textual patterns that is strongly correlated with the proposed effectiveness metrics while can be readily implemented in the design and production processes of commercial advertisements.

Moreover, we explore the effect of different methods of graph construction on the classification accuracy. To this end, the rs-fMRI data from 32 AD, 76 MCI, and 46 healthy elderly subjects are used along with three different connectivity measures: Pearson correlation, bend correlation, and mutual information. Both weighted and binary graphs are created for each subject at different density ranges. Based on each, various graph measures have been extracted. Finally, sequential floating forward selection and support vector machine are utilized. Our results suggest that bend correlation is more effective in the classification of AD and MCI. Moreover, weighted graphs and lower density ranges increase accuracy. Finally, bend correlation along with the weighted graph and density threshold of 10% generate the highest accuracy (93%).

Computational methods may lead to a quantitative analysis of these signals and hence to characterize EEG time series. The aim of this work is to achieve an automatic patients classification from the EEG biomedical signals involved in AD and MCI in order to support medical doctors in the right diagnosis formulation. The analysis of the biological EEG signals requires effective and efficient computer science methods to extract relevant information. Data mining, which guides the automated knowledge discovery process, is a natural way to approach EEG data analysis. Specifically, in our work we apply the following analysis steps: (i) pre-processing of EEG data; (ii) processing of the EEG-signals by the application of time-frequency transforms; and (iii) classification by means of machine learning methods.

Early diagnosis confers many benefits, including improved care and access to effective treatment. However, it is still a medical challenge due to the lack of an efficient and inexpensive way to assess cognitive function [1]. Although research on data from Neuroimaging and Brain Initiative and the advancement in data analytics has greatly enhanced our understanding of the underlying disease process, there is still a lack of complete knowledge regarding the indicative biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease. Recently, computer aided diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and AD with functional brain images using machine learning methods has become popular. However, the prediction accuracy remains unoptimistic, with prediction accuracy ranging from 60% to 88% [2,3,6]. Among them, support vector machine is the most popular classifier. However, because of the relatively small sample size and the amount of noise in functional brain imaging data, a single classifier cannot achieve high classification performance. Instead of using a global classifier, in this work, we aim to improve AD prediction accuracy by combining three different classifiers using weighted and unweighted schemes. We rank image-derived features according to their importance to the classification performance and show that the top ranked features are localized in the brain areas which have been found to associate with the progression of AD.

We address this issue by exploring novel automatic and objective methods for diagnosing patients through analysis of spontaneous speech. We detail several lexical approaches to the problem of detecting and rating DAT. The approaches explored rely on character n-gram-based techniques, shown recently to perform successfully in a different, but related task of automatic authorship attribution. We also explore the correlation of usage frequency of different parts of speech and DAT. We achieve a high 95% accuracy of detecting dementia when compared with a control group, and we achieve 70% accuracy in rating dementia in two classes, and 50% accuracy in rating dementia into four classes.

Generally, the developed mathematical model based on the one RL technique to handle the route decision in channel switching and user mobility situation so that the overall end-to-end delay can be minimized and the overall throughput of the network can be maximized according to the application requirement in CRAHN environment. Here is the proposed self-configuration method based on RL technique can improve the performance of the original AODV protocol, reducing protocol overhead and end-to-end delay for CRAHN while increasing the packet delivery ratio depending upon the traffic model. Simulation results are shown using NS-2 which shows the proposed model performance is much better than the previous AODV protocol.","","978-1-4799-7896-0978-1-4799-7897","10.1109/ISMSC.2015.7594025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7594025","Reinforcement Learning (RL);Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Networks (CRAHN);Routing;End-to-End Delay (ETE)","Routing;Routing protocols;Delays;Learning (artificial intelligence);Ad hoc networks;Throughput","ad hoc networks;closed loop systems;cognitive radio;discrete event simulation;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;networked control systems;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","reinforcement learning;cognitive radio ad-hoc network routing;network control systems;RL based network management agents;quality of service;QoS;network layer protocol parameter reconfiguration;network performance conditions;closed-loop approach;network layer protocol parameter tuning;channel interference;ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing;AODV routing;CRAHN environment;self-contained learning method;machine-learning techniques;cognitive routing protocols;channel switching;user mobility situation;overall end-to-end delay;self-configuration method;packet delivery ratio;traffic model;NS-2","","3","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This causes loss of cognitive functions such as reasoning, memory and other mental abilities which may be due to trauma or normal ageing. Alzheimer's disease is one of the types of the dementia which accounts to 60-80% of mental disorders [1]. For the diagnosis of such diseases many tests are conducted. In this paper, the authors have collected the data of 466 subjects by conducting neuro psychological test. The subjects are classified as demented or not using machine learning techniques. The authors have preprocessed the data. The data set is classified using Naive Bayes, Jrip and Random Forest. The data set is evaluated using explorer, knowledge flow and API.

However, a common bottleneck of the diagnostic performance is overfitting due to having lot of irrelevant features in the training data. In view of this fact, we propose a novel classification framework which uses unsupervised autoencoder network to select the subset from given structural and clinical features by exploring the linear and nonlinear relationship among them followed by a supervised multinomial logistic layer to automatically identify the patients having AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) clinical status.

This study sought to utilize the data collected from virtual reality (VR)-based software and a leap-motion device used for learning in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases to enable early detection of MCI by analyzing the classification rules for errors (action slips) based on finger-action transitions when performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Finger motion was recorded as a time-series database. An induction technique known as Inductive-Logic Programming (ILP), which uses logical and clausal language to represent the training data, was then used to discover a concise classification rule using logical programming. We were able to generate rules on how action transitions of the finger in the experiments were related to the pattern of micro-errors that indicate the difference of error regarding the length of the no-motion state of the finger.","","978-1-5386-0771-8978-1-5386-0770-1978-1-5386-0772","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2017.8109760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109760","Cognitive computing;Healthcare informatics;Mild cognitive impairment;Instrumental activities of daily living;Machine learning;Inductive-logic programming","Handheld computers;Medical services;Thumb;Programming;Databases;Tools","cognition;diseases;distributed databases;handicapped aids;health care;inductive logic programming;learning (artificial intelligence);logic programming;pattern classification;time series;virtual reality","early diagnosis;data collection routines;clinical science;heterogeneous database;machine learning;heterogeneous data sources;healthcare sciences;healthcare data;modern computational tools;virtual reality;leap-motion device;mild cognitive impairment cases;finger-action transitions;instrumental activities;finger motion;time-series database;logical language;clausal language;concise classification rule;logical programming;patient data storage;inductive-logic programming recent rapid advances","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the recent decade, a variety of machine learning algorithms have been explored and used for AD diagnosis, focusing on its subtle prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to assess essential features that characterize its early manifestation and to plan for early treatment. However, diagnosis of early MCI (EMCI) remains most challenging as it is extremely difficult to delineate from cognitively normal controls (CN), and as a consequence, most of the classification algorithms for these two groups are mixed with low classification accuracy results. In this study, a machine learning approach based on deep neural network (DNN) has been proposed in order to detect AD in its early stage using multimodal imaging, combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and standard neuropsychological test scores. The proposed approach makes use of the optimization method of Adam to update the learning weights in order to improve its accuracy. The algorithm is able to classify cognitively normal control group from EMCI with an unprecedented accuracy of 84.0%. Although the focus here is distinguishing the two groups of CN and EMCI for early diagnosis and treatment planning, this study also shows how the proposed deep learning algorithm can be extended for multiclass classification involving CN and all the stages of EMCI, late MCI (LMCI) and AD.","","978-1-5386-6805-4978-1-5386-6806","10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614243","Artificial Intelligence;Deep Neural Network;MRI;PET;EMCI;Alzheimer's Disease","Conferences;Machine learning","biomedical MRI;cognition;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;patient treatment;positron emission tomography;psychology","deep neural network approach;mild cognitive impairment;prevalent neurodegenerative disease;neuronal atrophy;amyloid deposition;psychological deficits;machine learning algorithms;AD diagnosis;early MCI;EMCI;classification algorithms;positron emission tomography;learning weights;treatment planning;deep learning algorithm;neuropsychological test scores;magnetic resonance imaging;multimodal imaging;behavioral deficits;Alzheimer's disease","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is to find the spectrum opportunities in temporal, spectral, and spatial domains in the presence of unreliable sensing data and unavailable location information. In spectrum-heterogeneous networks, the availability of spectrum varies over the space and different sensors experience different spectrum opportunities. Thus, the measurements from sensors cannot be simply aggregated to detect the spectrum opportunities. Moreover, unreliable data will negatively impact the decision-making process. The task of inferring the spectrum status becomes even more challenging when the sensors are not equipped with location-finding technologies. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to cluster the sensors solely based on their observations, not requiring any prior knowledge of the network topology, location of the sensors, or the number of clusters. After receiving the sensing data, the base station updates the probability distributions of cluster membership, channel availability, and device reliability. All the update rules are derived mathematically by the variational inference. Then, the distributions are employed to find spectrum opportunities via multi-label graph cuts method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to existing algorithms.","2332-7731;2372-2045","","10.1109/TCCN.2017.2787710","Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240657","Cognitive radio ad hoc networks;dynamic spectrum access;consensus-based cooperative spectrum sensing;clustering methods;graph theory","Sensors;Reliability;Frequency measurement;Bayes methods;Inference algorithms;Performance evaluation;Cognitive radio","Bayes methods;cognitive radio;data mining;decision making;graph theory;pattern clustering;probability;radio networks;radio spectrum management;signal detection;statistical distributions;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology","spectrum-heterogeneous cognitive radio networks;Bayesian data-mining approach;dynamic spectrum sensing;unreliable sensing data;Bayesian clustering;cooperative spectrum opportunity detection;spatial domains;spectral domains;temporal domains;unavailable location information;decision-making process;location-finding technologies;probabilistic model;network topology;probability distributions;cluster membership;channel availability;device reliability;update rules;variational inference;multilabel graph cuts method;Co-SpOT","","1","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, it is usually a time-costing task to label a large-scale data in clinical practice, which results in the neuroimaging dataset for AD is a small sample size. The semi-supervised learning (SSL), which has the ability to employ the easily acquired unlabeled data to assist insufficient labeled data for improving learning performance, have attracted considerable interest for AD classification. The co-training classification is a representative paradigm of disagreement-based SSL method. It trains alternately to maximize the mutual agreement on two preferably independent views (feature subsets) of the unlabeled data. Since the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are the commonly used neuroimaging techniques for AD diagnosis, co-training method has the potential to perform semi-supervised classification of AD with both MRI and PET data. In this paper, we propose the co-training based SSL with MRI and PET images for classification of AD with the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) data as the unlabeled samples.

With this as a starting point, we investigate the relation between SVF results and MMSE/CDR-SOB scores. We use regression models to predict scores based on persons' SVF performance. Over a set of 179 patients with different degree of dementia, we achieve a mean absolute error of of 2.2 for MMSE (range 0-30) and 1.7 for CDR-SOB (range 0-18).

This paper discusses the importance of investigating Alzheimer's Disease using machine learning, the need to use both behavioural and biological markers data, and a computational method to rank Alzheimer's Disease risk factors by importance using different machine learning models on Alzheimer's Disease clinical assessment data from ADNI. The dataset contains Alzheimer's Disease risk factors data related to medical history, family dementia history, demographical, and some lifestyle data for 1635 subjects. There are 387 normal control, 87 significant memory concerns, 289 early mild cognitive impairment, 539 late mild cognitive impairment and 333 Alzheimer's Disease subjects. We deployed different machine learning models on the dataset to rank the importance of the variables (risk factors).

In this work, after analyzing the pattern of structural and clinical data from tadpole study in Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database, it has been found that the unobserved data are not missing completely at random. In view of this fact, with the assumption that the missing data patterns are in blocks, we propose a novel stacked sparse autoencoder based method to assign a value in the missing places and to select the significant structural and clinical features in order to discriminate the patients having AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) clinical status.

Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have focused on the slowing of oscillatory brain rhythms, coupled with complexity reduction of the corresponding time-series and their enhanced compressibility. These analyses have been typically carried out on single channels. However, limited investigations have focused on the possibility yielded by computational intelligence methodologies and novel machine learning approaches applied to multichannel schemes. The study at screening level on EEG recordings of subjects at risk could be useful to highlight the emergence of underlying AD progression (or at least support any further clinical investigation). In this work, the representational power of Deep Learning on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is exploited to generate suitable sets of features that are then able to classify EEG patterns of AD from a prodromal version of dementia (Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) and from age-matched Healthy Controls (HC). The processing system here used enforces a series of convolutional-subsampling layers in order to derive a multivariate assembly of latent, novel patterns, finally used to categorize sets of EEG from different classes of subjects. The final processor here proposed is able to reach an averaged 80% of correct classification with good performance on both sensitivity and specificity by using a Multilayered Feedforward Perceptron (MLP) of the standard type as a final block of the procedure.","","978-1-5090-1131-5978-1-5090-1132","10.1109/RTSI.2016.7740576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7740576","Alzheimer's disease;Mild Cognitive Impairment;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Networks;Scalp EEG","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Databases;Diseases;Standards;Time-frequency analysis;Scalp","diseases;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets","deep convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease patients;scalp EEG recordings;EEG classification;pathophysiological mechanism;electroencephalography;oscillatory brain rhythms;computational intelligence methodologies;machine learning approaches;AD progression;mild cognitive impairment;healthy controls;convolutional-subsampling layers;multilayered feedforward perceptron","","5","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the medical databases have heterogeneous features with different levels of severity patterns. Feature extraction and classification of high risk patterns may have potential benefits for decision making. In the medical applications, data classification algorithms are used to detect the disease severity that can help in early prediction of new type of disease patterns. Also, machine learning algorithms are more accurate, high true positive rate and reliable for heterogeneous features. Traditional classification models such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, Feed forward neural networks, Regression models, etc are used to classify the homogeneous disease datasets with limited feature space. As the size of the Alzheimer's disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are failed to process the disease patterns due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient classification model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is essential with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, a novel feature selection based classification model is proposed to improve the disease classification rate and testing the new type of disease patterns for real-time patient disease prediction. In the proposed model, a novel probabilistic based feature selection measure for classification algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time patient disease prediction using the training datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed feature selection based classification algorithm is better than the traditional algorithms in terms of true positive rate, error rate and F-measure are concerned.","","978-1-5386-3360-1978-1-5386-3359-5978-1-5386-3361","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2018.8482045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8482045","feature selection;alzheimer disease;ensemble classification;SVM;decision tree","Handheld computers;Information technology;Decision trees;Q measurement;Alzheimer's disease;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;decision making;diseases;feature extraction;feature selection;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;patient diagnosis;regression analysis;support vector machines","feature extraction;severity patterns;high risk patterns;medical applications;data classification algorithms;disease severity;machine learning algorithms;homogeneous disease datasets;feature space;disease prediction rate;error rate;heterogeneous feature types;feature selection based classification model;disease classification rate;real-time patient disease prediction;feature selection based classification algorithm;medical databases;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;real-time medical disease prediction;COPD;decision making;Naive Bayes;SVM;feed forward neural networks;regression models;Alzheimers disease patterns;probabilistic based feature selection measure;F-measure","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Without the availability of a cure, nor a standardised clinical test, the utilisation of machine learning methods to identify individuals that are at risk of developing dementia could bring a new step towards proactive intervention. This study's goal is to carry out a precursor analysis leading to building classification models with enhanced capabilities for differentiating diagnoses of CN (Cognitively Normal), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and Dementia. The predictive modelling approach we propose is based on the ReliefF method combined with statistical permutation tests for feature selection, and on model training, tuning, and testing based on algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Stability of model performances were studied in computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations. The results consistently show that our models accurately detect dementia, and also mild cognitive impairment patients by only using the inclusion of baseline measurements as predictors, thus illustrating the importance of baseline measurements. The best results issued from Monte Carlo were achieved by eXtreme Gradient Boosting optimised models, with an accuracy of 0.88 (SD 0.02), a sensitivity of 0.93 (SD 0.02) and a specificity of 0.94 (SD 0.01) for dementia, and a sensitivity of 0.86 (SD 0.02) and a specificity of 0.9 (SD 0.02) for mild cognitive impairment.

Then, a small number of templates is selected among the previously obtained sub images, able to describe the morphological variability present in the whole population. Finally an automatic procedure is prepared which, on the basis of the given set of templates, is able to find both hippocampal formations in any new MR image. MR images ranging from normalcy to extreme atrophy can be successfully processed. The proposed approach, besides being a preliminary step towards the unsupervised segmentation of the hippocampus, extracts from the MR image information useful for diagnostic purposes and, in particular, could give the possibility of performing morphometric studies on the medial temporal lobe in an automated way.

The aim of many studies is not classification, however, but investigation of multivariate spatial patterns, which pattern classifiers detect only indirectly. Here we propose a direct statistical measure for the existence of distributed spatial patterns (or spatial heterogeneity) applicable to fMRI datasets. We extend the univariate general linear model (GLM), typically used in fMRI analysis, to a multivariate case. We demonstrate that contrasting maximum likelihood estimations of different restrictions on this multivariate model can be used to estimate the extent of spatial heterogeneity in fMRI data. Under asymptotic assumptions inference can be made with reference to the χ<sup>2</sup>distribution. The test statistic is then assessed using simulated timecourses derived from real fMRI data followed by analyzing data from a real fMRI experiment. These analyses demonstrate the utility of the proposed measure of heterogeneity as well as considerations in its application.

Using the sensor and clinical data pertaining to 97 subjects, acquired over an average period of three years, a number of measures associated with the subjects' walking speed and general activity in the home were calculated. Different time spans of these measures were used to generate feature vectors to train and test two machine learning algorithms namely support vector machines and random forests. We were able to autonomously detect MCI in older adults with an area under the ROC curve of 0.97 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.93 using a time window of 24 weeks.

This study evaluated the use of finger movement data obtained from the virtual-reality-based application and its ability to cluster patients with everyday action impairment. Here, as a pilot study, nine healthy adults completed lunch box packing as an everyday action task in the designated virtual reality called the Virtual Kitchen (VK), equipped with a leap motion controller to record their finger movement. We converted the finger movements to acceleration data and then employed a time series clustering algorithm to create several clusters based on the data set. In addition, to comprehensively review the clustering result, we assessed performance-based measures for the experiment using the Naturalistic Action Test (NAT).

Although the large majority of the existing techniques rely on a single classifier such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), several ensemble methods such as Adaboost or Random Forests (RF) have also been explored. The ensemble methods combine the outputs of several classifiers and aim to increase performance by exploring the diversity of the base classifiers in terms of features or examples, which are usually randomly selected. In this paper we propose using a different kind of ensemble to address the three class problem of classifying AD, MCI and Control Normals (CN) from PET brain images. We propose the favourite class ensemble of classifiers where each base classifier in the ensemble uses a different feature subset which is optimized for a given class. Since different image features correspond to different sets of brain voxels, the proposed favourite class classifiers are able to take into account the fact that the spatial pattern of brain degeneration in AD changes in time as the disease progresses. We tested this approach on FDG-PET images from The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using as base classifiers both Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). The ensembles systematically outperformed the corresponding single classifier with the best result (66.78%) being obtained by the SVM ensemble.","1094-687X;1558-4615","978-1-4577-0216","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610042","","Support vector machines;Alzheimer's disease;Radio frequency;Positron emission tomography;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain","brain;cognition;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;positron emission tomography;random processes;support vector machines","Alzheimer disease classification;FDG-PET images;favourite class ensembles;mild cognitive impairment;brain images;machine learning methods;support vector machine;SVM;Adaboost forests;random forests;image features;brain voxels;spatial pattern;brain degeneration;Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database;position emission tomography","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alzheimer Disease;Brain;Cognitive Dysfunction;Female;Fluorodeoxyglucose F18;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Male;Neuroimaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Positron-Emission Tomography;Radiopharmaceuticals;Support Vector Machine","7","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, assistive health care system for dementia is essential and feasible through the smart home. Activity recognition, decision support, and clinical score assessment are the various phases concerned in modeling dementia care system. This research work focuses specifically on clinical score assessment that measures the performance of the activities in terms of cognitive and mobility traits of the dementia patient. This progressive estimation provides decision support system to the doctors so as to offer appropriate treatment based on patient's performance in daily activities. The usual procedure for clinical assessment is a questionnaire session which is prone to errors. Therefore, the proposed system models a progressive assessment framework for dementia care through the smart home that integrates supervised machine learning and context-based reasoning to perform context-based clinical assessment.

Brain function connectivity networks constructed from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), have been widely used for classifying MCI from normal controls (NC). In this paper, a sparse representation-based method called sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) constructs functional brain connectivity and distinguishes MCI patients from NC. One limitation of SICE methodology is its sensitivity to regularization parameters. To address this issue, a nested-cross validation framework was added to tune the regularization parameter through the machine learning process. After acquiring the optimal regularization parameter, a two-stage feature selection approach is performed on the brain network-based feature matrix to select the most discriminative features. Next, a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained for classification using these selected optimal features. The experiment results indicated a cross-validation accuracy of 91.89% with a sensitivity of 83.3%, and a specificity of 96%. The positive results illustrate the excellent diagnostic power of the SICE method. The proposed method found comparative differences between brain regions in MCI patients versus NC patients, which is consistent with findings in reported literatures.","","978-1-5386-1620-8978-1-5386-1621","10.1109/IST.2017.8261535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8261535","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI);Resting-state fMRI;Sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE);Functional connectivity network;Classification","Covariance matrices;Training;Feature extraction;Sparse matrices;Support vector machines;Estimation","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;diseases;feature extraction;feature selection;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology;support vector machines","sparse inverse covariance network;mild cognitive impairment classification;brain function connectivity networks;resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging;rs-fMRI;sparse representation;sparse inverse covariance estimation;functional brain connectivity;SICE methodology;nested-cross validation framework;machine learning process;optimal regularization parameter;two-stage feature selection approach;brain network;feature matrix;discriminative features;linear support vector machine classifier;selected optimal features;cross-validation accuracy;SICE method;brain regions;NC patients;MCI patients;MCI classification","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm is inspired by human metacognitive learning principles and has two components: a cognitive component and a metacognitive component. The cognitive component is a single-hidden-layer radial basis function network with evolving architecture. The metacognitive component controls the learning process in the cognitive component by choosing the best learning strategy for the current sample and adapts the learning strategies by implementing self-regulation. In addition, sample overlapping conditions and past knowledge of the samples in the form of pseudosamples are used for proper initialization of new hidden neurons to minimize the misclassification. The parameter update strategy uses projection-based direct minimization of hinge loss error. The interaction of the cognitive component and the metacognitive component addresses the what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn human learning principles efficiently. The performance of the PBL-McRBFN is evaluated using a set of benchmark classification problems from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. The statistical performance evaluation on these problems proves the superior performance of the PBL-McRBFN classifier over results reported in the literature. Also, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a practical Alzheimer's disease detection problem. The performance results on open access series of imaging studies and Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative datasets, which are obtained from different demographic regions, clearly show that PBL-McRBFN can handle a problem with change in distribution.","2162-237X;2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2226748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392289","Alzheimer's disease;metacognitive learning;projection-based learning;radial basis function network classifier;self-regulatory thresholds","Neurons;Training;Radial basis function networks;Fasteners;Mathematical model;Current measurement;Humans","learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;pattern classification;radial basis function networks;statistical analysis","sequential projection-based metacognitive learning;radial basis function network;classification problem;human metacognitive learning principle;cognitive component;metacognitive component;single-hidden-layer radial basis function network;learning strategy;parameter update strategy;projection-based direct minimization;hinge loss error;what-to-learn human learning principle;when-to-learn human learning principle;how-to-learn human learning principle;University of California Irvine machine learning repository;statistical performance evaluation;Alzheimers disease detection problem","","73","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Enhanced algorithms are being designed and applied on large datasets to help discover hidden insights and correlations amongst data elements not obvious to human. These insights help businesses take better decisions and optimize key indicators of interest. The growing popularity of machine learning also stems from the fact that learning algorithms are agnostic to the domain of application. Classification algorithms, for example, that could be applied to categorize faults in windmill blades can also be used for categorizing TV viewers in a survey. The actual value of machine learning however depends on the ability to adapt and apply these algorithms to solve specific real world problems. In this paper we discuss two such applications for interpreting medical data for automated analysis. Our first case study demonstrates the use of Bayesian Inference, a paradigm of machine learning, for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease based on cognitive test results and demographic data. In the second case study we focus on automated classification of cell images to determine the advancement and severity of breast cancer using artificial neural networks. Although these research are still preliminary, they demonstrate the value of machine learning techniques in providing quick, efficient and automated data analysis. Machine learning offers hope with early diagnosis of diseases, help patients in making informed decisions on treatment options and can help in improving overall quality of their lives.","","978-1-5090-1613-6978-1-5090-1614","10.1109/AERO.2017.7943950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943950","","Alzheimer's disease;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Medical diagnostic imaging","Bayes methods;cancer;data analysis;health care;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);medical administrative data processing;neural nets;patient diagnosis;pattern classification","machine learning;prognosis;healthcare;classification algorithms;medical data;Bayesian inference;Alzheimer disease diagnosis;cognitive test;breast cancer;artificial neural networks;automated data analysis","","2","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Selected features included one- and two-way combinations of subcortical and cortical volumes as well as cortical thickness and curvature of numerous brain regions which are known to be vulnerable to AD. Additionally, several feature combinations were fed into support vector machines (SVMs) as well as Naïve Bayes classifiers in order to compare scheme accuracy. The most efficient combination of features and classification scheme, which employed both subcortical and cortical volumes feature vectors and a SVM classifier, was able to distinguish mild AD patients from healthy controls with 86% accuracy (82% sensitivity and 90% specificity). While this investigation is of preliminary nature, and further efforts are currently underway towards automated feature selection, best classifier determination and parameter optimization, our results appear very promising in terms of automated high-accuracy discrimination of disease stages which cannot easily be distinguished though routine clinical investigation.","1558-4615;1094-687X;1557-170X;1557-170X","978-1-4577-1787-1978-1-4244-4119","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345959","","Alzheimer's disease;Magnetic resonance imaging;Support vector machines;Vectors;Accuracy;Machine learning","Bayes methods;biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;drugs;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;optimisation;sensitivity;support vector machines","mild Alzheimer disease identification;automated structural MRI feature classification;neuroimaging data;drugs;delay disease progression;effective machine learning scheme;leverage structural magnetic resonance imaging features;subcortical volumes;cortical volumes;cortical thickness;numerous brain regions;support vector machines;SVM;naive Bayes classifiers;sensitivity;automated feature selection;parameter optimization;automated high-accuracy discrimination;routine clinical investigation","Aged;Alzheimer Disease;Alzheimer Disease;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Brain;Case-Control Studies;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Mild Cognitive Impairment;Mild Cognitive Impairment;Support Vector Machines","2","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous works have primarily focused on using a single Resting-State Network (RSN) with various techniques. Here, we apply fusion analysis of RSNs to capturing biomarkers that can combine the complementary information among the RSNs. Experiments are carried out on three groups of subjects, i.e., Cognition Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) groups, which correspond to the three progressing stages of AD; each group contains 18 subjects. First, we apply group Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to extracting the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) for each subject group. Then, by obtaining the common DMN and DAN as templates for each group, we employ the individual ICA to extract the DMN and DAN for each subject. Finally, we fuse the DMNs and DANs to explore the biomarkers. The results show that (1) the templates generated by group ICA can extract the RSN for each subject by individual ICA effectively; (2) the RSNs combined with the fusion analysis can obtain more informative biomarkers than without fusion analysis; (3) the most different regions of DMN and DAN are found between CN and EMCI and between EMCI and AD, which show differences. For the DMN, the difference in the medial prefrontal cortex between the EMCI and AD is smaller than that between CN and EMCI, whereas that in the posterior cingulate between EMCI and AD is larger. As for the DAN, the difference in the intraparietal sulcus is smaller than that between CN and EMCI; (4) extracting DMN and DAN for each subject via the back reconstruction of group ICA is invalid.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8660531","Independent Component Analysis (ICA);group analysis;fusion analysis;Alzheimer's Disease (AD)","Biomarkers;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Data mining;Task analysis;Alzheimer's disease;Medical diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

The system is based on an Information Extraction (IE) module to extract meaningful health information, a couple of ontologies to interpret the meaning and classify the extracted information into a logical hierarchy and an ad hoc developed structured data frame to gather the information. The system was designed to be compliant with the clinical best practices of the audiological/ENT (Ear-Nose-Throat) medical domains to ensure its ease of use in the real practice. The performance was assessed by measuring the percentage of information correctly extracted by the system against the one manual extracted by two experts.

This process enables an unauthorized access by recording the voice of the authorized person. So there is a requirement to prevent unauthorized access through recording speech. Other than voice biometrics, here we have two challenges. (i) To extract the authentication information. (ii) To find the unauthorized source. The speech goes through DA-AD-DA conversion, while it is recorded and used for access control. The watermarking method which will use for this purpose must be robust to DA-AD conversion attack, which is usually involved in recordings. In this work, we propose a method based on casting Log Co-ordinate Mapping (LCM), in which embedding two watermark segments in two different frequency regions, one for authentication information purpose and other for finding unauthorized source.

However, the process of creating these VOIS for multiple subjects can be time-intensive and there are many chances to introduce variability on inter- and intra-investigator levels. Although previous work has shown that image normalization through cortical surface mapping can be helpful in VOI analysis, the process is complicated and labor-intensive. In this paper we present a method to eliminate this variability by warping structural and functional images to a common space in which valid VOIs already exist. We apply this method to a study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 2-(1-{6-[(2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP), which is known to co-localize with amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. We normalize the MRIs of control subjects and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients, to a common space. The same normalization is applied to FDDNP PET images. The normalization technique reduces average voxel-to-voxel variance in MRIs by 54% as compared to linear normalization alone. Biologically important structures, such as the segmentation between white and gray matter, are maintained after normalization. Discriminant analysis shows that data extracted from VOIs in the common space out-performs data extracted from unnormalized PET images in classifying subjects as control, MCI, or AD. This suggests that image normalization may be useful in eliminating inter- and intra-investigator variability and increasing the predictive capability of data extracted from imaging modalities. Further study will examine the applicability of this method to predicting longitudinal changes in cognitive ability from functional imaging data.","1082-3654;1082-3654","978-1-4244-9105-6978-1-4244-9106-3978-1-4244-9104","10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5874339","","Positron emission tomography;Magnetic resonance imaging;Data mining;Aerospace electronics;Data models;Brain modeling;Biomedical imaging","biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;image resolution;image segmentation;medical image processing;neurophysiology;positron emission tomography","automated VOI analysis;<;sup>;18<;/sup>;F-FDDNP PET;structural warping;Alzheimer disease patients;2-(1-{6-[(2-[<;sup>;18<;/sup>;F]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile;amyloid plaques;neurofibrillary tangles;MRI;mild cognitive impairment;normalization technique;voxel-to-voxel variance;image segmentation;white matter;gray matter;intra-investigator variability;inter-investigator variability;imaging modality","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is challenging to find those networks from the whole connectivity network due to the complexity of brain networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method to mine the discriminative subnetworks for classifying MCI patients from healthy controls (HC). Specifically, we first apply multiple thresholds to generate multiple thresholded connectivity networks, and extract a set of frequent subnetworks from each of the two groups (i.e., MCI and HC), respectively. Then, we measure the discriminative ability of those frequent subnetworks using graph-kernel-based classification method and select the most discriminative subnetworks for subsequent classification. The results on the functional connectivity networks of 12 MCI and 25 HC show that our method can obtain a competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods on MCI classification.","","978-1-4799-4149-0978-1-4799-4150","10.1109/PRNI.2014.6858518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6858518","","Kernel;Accuracy;Alzheimer's disease;Testing;Training;Data mining","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;data mining;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;medical image processing;neurophysiology","discriminative subnetwork mining;multiple thresholded connectivity-networks-based classification;mild cognitive impairment;brain connectivity networks;brain diseases;Alzheimers disease;large-scale connectivity networks;individual brain regions;discriminative subnetworks;frequent subnetwork extraction;discriminative ability;graph-kernel-based classification method;functional connectivity networks;functional magnetic resonance imaging","","1","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The task we address in this paper is the automatic generation of image descriptions that are anchored in spatial relations. We construe this as a three-step task where the first step is to identify objects in an image, the second step detects spatial relations between object pairs on the basis of language and visual features; and in the third step, the spatial relations are mapped to natural language (NL) descriptions. We describe the data we have created, and compare a range of machine learning methods in terms of the success with which they learn the mapping from features to spatial relations, using automatic and human-assessed evaluations. We find that a random forest model performs best by a substantial margin. We examine aspects of our approach in more detail, including data annotation and choice of features.

As a result, learnt models fail to generalize across domains, heavily restricting their usability beyond single applications. In this article, we focus on the problem of domain adaptation for natural language generation. We show how linguistic knowledge from a source domain, for which labelled data is available, can be adapted to a target domain by reusing training data across domains. As a key to this, we propose to employ abstract meaning representations as a common semantic representation across domains. We model natural language generation as a long short-term memory recurrent neural network encoder-decoder, in which one recurrent neural network learns a latent representation of a semantic input, and a second recurrent neural network learns to decode it to a sequence of words. We show that the learnt representations can be transferred across domains and can be leveraged effectively to improve training on new unseen domains. Experiments in three different domains and with six datasets demonstrate that the lexical-syntactic constructions learnt in one domain can be transferred to new domains and achieve up to 75-100% of the performance of in-domain training. This is based on objective metrics such as BLEU and semantic error rate and a subjective human rating study. Training a policy from prior knowledge from a different domain is consistently better than pure in-domain training by up to 10%.","1556-603X;1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2017.2708558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7983466","","Semantics;Natural languages;Training;Stochastic processes;Pragmatics;Adaptation models;Machine learning;Natural language processing","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;recurrent neural nets","domain transfer;deep natural language generation;abstract meaning representation;stochastic natural language generation system;semantic input representation;lexical-syntactic output;linguistic knowledge;recurrent neural network;BLEU metric;semantic error rate;subjective human rating study","","","75","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Stroke patients underwent two complete neuropsychological assessments between the first 72 hours after stroke arrival and three months later. They were further evaluated with a MRI protocol at 3 months. Patients were splitted into two groups according to their level of cognitive recovery. A data mining technique was then applied to the probabilistic tractography data in order to determine whether the structural connectivity features can efficiently classify good from poor recovery. We found that the connectivity probability between the left Superior Parietal Gyrus and the left Angular Gyrus can describe the cognitive classification (good versus poor recovery) after stroke. Both regions are involved in higher cognitive functioning and their dysfunction has been related to mild cognitive impairment and dementia.

In this study, we propose a module identification method that maps the GWAS results of an imaging phenotype onto the corresponding tissue-specific functional interaction network by applying a machine learning framework. Ridge regression and support vector machine (SVM) models are constructed to re-prioritize GWAS results, followed by exploring hippocampus-relevant modules based on top predictions using GWAS top findings.

Kampf","Aarhus University, Denmark; Aarhus University, Denmark; Aarhus University, Denmark; Aarhus University, Denmark","IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication","","2014","57","1","56","74","Technical writers and translators struggle with language consistency in emerging technologies. Corpus linguistics can track language structures in such quickly developing environments. An ad-hoc corpus may be the tool needed for technical communicators. Key concepts: Mega-corpora versus ad-hoc corpora: The term “mega-corpora” typically covers the existing national corpora, whereas ad-hoc corpora can be created quickly for technical communication. Variation versus consistency: variation covers the range of possible solutions compared to the need for consistency of terminology in given contexts. Representativeness versus adequacy: representativeness defines the possibility of variation within the scope of the field; in contrast , adequacy represents contextual suitability. Key lessons: To use ad-hoc corpora as a tool for keeping track of and understanding language variation in texts about emerging technology: (1) design and compile a small set of relevant descriptions regarding the emerging technology, (2) use the software corpus tool representation of corpora to evaluate whether the ad-hoc corpus is representative-meaning that adding new texts does not add new words or variations in terminology use, (3) use the software corpus tool AntConc to analyze the ad-hoc corpus finding concordance patterns and variation in terminology usage, and (4) use linguistic strategies for selecting terminology based on linguistic evidence rather than intuition. Implications for practice: The ad-hoc corpus method offers an evidence-based approach for determining patterns of terminology. This method can be applied to standardizing product documentation or tracking variations in language use and can help technical writers and translators keep track of evolving terminology for emerging technologies.","0361-1434;1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2014.2307011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762962","Ad-hoc corpora;AntConc;controlled language;corpus linguistics;representation of corpora (ReCor);search engine optimization (SEO);technical communication;translation","Terminology;Pragmatics;Context;Search engines;Vocabulary;Tutorials;Writing","language translation;natural language processing;search engines;text analysis","emerging technologies;technical writing;translation;search engine optimization;corpus linguistics;language structures;mega-corpora;ad-hoc corpora;national corpora;technical communication;terminology variation;terminology consistency;contextual suitability;variation possibility;representativeness;adequacy;software corpus tool representation;AntConc;concordance patterns;linguistic evidence;product documentation","","3","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many different ad-hoc models have been built in user modeling as well as in student modeling, using either expert knowledge elicitation or machine learning techniques but none of these methods is perfectly adapted to the case of student modeling. Moreover, the evolution of the student cognitive state only leads to probability update in these models, whereas we think that the topology of the network should also vary in order to reflect the changes in the student knowledge structure. We propose a general framework for embedding different Bayesian network student models in an architecture that handles transitions between them and dynamic adaptation to the learner.

Collecting users' feedback through pairwise preferences is recommended over other ranking approaches as this method is more appealing for human decision making. Learning models from pairwise preference data is however an NP-hard problem. Therefore, constructing models that can effectively learn such data is a challenging task. Models are usually constructed with accuracy being the most important factor. Another vitally important aspect that is usually given less attention is expressiveness, i.e. how easy it is to explain the relationship between the model input and output. Most machine learning techniques are focused either on performance or on expressiveness. This paper employ MARS models which have the advantage of being a powerful method for function approximation as well as being relatively easy to interpret. MARS models are evolved based on their efficiency in learning pairwise data. The method is tested on two datasets that collectively provide pairwise preference data of five cognitive states expressed by users. The method is analysed in terms of the performance, expressiveness and complexity and showed promising results in all aspects.","1089-778X;1941-0026","978-1-4799-7492-4978-1-4799-7491","10.1109/CEC.2015.7257154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7257154","","Mars;Data models;Predictive models;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Grammar;Complexity theory","computational complexity;decision making;evolutionary computation;function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;splines (mathematics)","preference learning;evolutionary multivariate adaptive regression spline model;evolutionary method;user feedback;human decision making;NP-hard problem;model input-output relationship;machine learning techniques;function approximation;MARS models;pairwise data learning;cognitive states","","4","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Travel patterns are classified as direct, pacing, lapping, or random according to MS model. MS travel pattern is highly related with person's cognitive state, thus can be used to detect early stage of dementia. The dataset was collected by monitoring a cognitively normal elderly resident by wireless passive infrared sensors for 21 months. First, over 70000 travel episodes are extracted from the dataset and classified by MS travel pattern classifier algorithm for the ground truth. Later, 12000 episodes (3000 for each pattern) were randomly selected from the total episodes to compose training and testing dataset. Finally, DCNN performance was compared with three other classical machine-learning classifiers. The Random Forest and DCNN yielded the best classification accuracies of 94.48% and 97.84%, respectively.

Since we work on a real life application and the tweets are freely worded, we introduce text correction, normalization and root finding algorithms. Although text processing and classification are highly important due to many applications such as emotion recognition, advertisement selection, etc., online classification and regression algorithms over text are limited due to need for high dimensional vectors to represent natural text inputs. We overcome such limitations by showing that randomized projections and piecewise linear models can be efficiently leveraged to significantly reduce the computational cost for feature vector extraction from the tweets. Hence, we can perform multi-class tweet classification and regression in real time. We demonstrate our results over tweets collected from a real life case study where the tweets are freely-worded, e.g., with emoticons, shortened words, special characters, etc., and are unstructured.

We argue that ""without cognitive learning the goal of achieving human-level synthetic intelligence is far from completion. Here we review the principles underlying human learning and memory, and identify three of them, i.e., continuity, glocality, and compositionality, as the most fundamental to human-level machine learning. We then propose the recently-developed hypernetwork model as a candidate architecture for cognitive learning and memory. Hypernetworks are a random hypergraph structure higher-order probabilistic relations of data by an evolutionary self-organizing process based on molecular self- assembly. The chemically-based massive interaction for information organization and processing in the molecular hypernetworks, referred to as hyperinteractionism, is contrasted ""with the symbolist, connectionist, and dynamicist approaches to mind and intelligence. We demonstrate the generative learning capability of the hypernetworks to simulate linguistic recall memory, visual imagery, and language-vision crossmodal translation based on a video corpus of movies and dramas in a multimodal memory game environment.

Even though some works have detected dementia from speech and language attributes, most have applied detection using picture descriptions, narratives, and cognitive tasks. In this paper, we propose a new computer avatar with spoken dialog functionalities that produces spoken queries based on the mini-mental state examination, the Wechsler memory scale-revised, and other related neuropsychological questions. We recorded the interactive data of spoken dialogues from 29 participants (14 dementia and 15 healthy controls) and extracted various audiovisual features. We tried to predict dementia using audiovisual features and two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and logistic regression). Here, we show that the support vector machines outperformed logistic regression, and by using the extracted features they classified the participants into two groups with 0.93 detection performance, as measured by the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

"Efficient Algorithms for Finding Richer Subgroup Descriptions in Numeric and Nominal Data","M. Mampaey; S. Nijssen; A. Feelders; A.

How these systems deal with numeric and nominal data has a large impact on the quality of their results. In this paper, we consider two ways to extend the standard pattern language of subgroup discovery: using conditions that test for interval membership for numeric attributes, and value set membership for nominal attributes. We assume a greedy search setting, that is, iteratively refining a given subgroup, with respect to a (convex) quality measure. For numeric attributes, we propose an algorithm that finds the optimal interval in linear (rather than quadratic) time, with respect to the number of examples and split points. Similarly, for nominal attributes, we show that finding the optimal set of values can be achieved in linear (rather than exponential) time, with respect to the number of examples and the size of the domain of the attribute. These algorithms operate by only considering subgroup refinements that lie on a convex hull in ROC space, thus significantly narrowing down the search space. We further provide efficient algorithms specifically for the popular Weighted Relative Accuracy quality measure, taking advantage of some of its properties. Our algorithms are shown to perform well in practice, and furthermore provide additional expressive power leading to higher-quality results.","1550-4786;1550-4786;2374-8486","978-1-4673-4649-8978-0-7695-4905","10.1109/ICDM.2012.117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413744","subgroup discovery;numeric data;nominal data;convex functions;ROC analysis","Data mining;Context;Decision trees;Accuracy;Weight measurement;Complexity theory;Gain measurement","data mining","subgroup descriptions;numeric data;nominal data;subgroup discovery systems;interesting patterns;labeled data;standard pattern language;interval membership;numeric attributes;value set membership;nominal attributes;greedy search setting;linear time;convex hull;ROC space;weighted relative accuracy quality measure","","6","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the single life style cannot be maintained if they have dementia. Thus, the early detection of dementia is crucial. Systems with wearable devices or cameras are not preferred choice for the long-term monitoring. Main intention of this paper is to propose deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) classifier for indoor travel patterns of elderly people living alone using open data set collected by device-free non-privacy invasive binary (passive infrared) sensor data. Travel patterns are classified as direct, pacing, lapping, or random according to Martino-Saltzman (MS) model. MS travel pattern is highly related with person's cognitive state, and thus can be used to detect early stage of dementia. We have utilized an open data set that was presented by Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems project, Washington State University. The data set was collected by monitoring a cognitively normal elderly person by wireless passive infrared sensors for 21 months. First, 117 320 travel episodes are extracted from the data set and classified by MS travel pattern classifier algorithm for the ground truth. Later, 12 000 episodes (3000 for each pattern) were randomly selected from the total episodes to compose training and testing data set. Finally, DCNN performance was compared with seven other classical machine-learning classifiers. The random forest and DCNN yielded the best classification accuracies of 94.48% and 97.84%, respectively. Thus, the proposed DCNN classifier can be used to infer dementia through travel pattern matching.","1530-437X;1558-1748;2379-9153","","10.1109/JSEN.2017.2771287","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101507","Non-privacy invasive;deep learning;device-free;assistive technology;smart house;travel pattern;elder care","Sensors;Lapping;Senior citizens;Dementia;Training;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring","computerised instrumentation;geriatrics;infrared detectors;intelligent sensors;neural nets;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","device-free nonprivacy invasive classification;smart house;PIR sensor;DCNN;elderly care cost;privacy invasion;dementia detection;wearable device;camera;deep convolutional neural network;indoor travel pattern classification;device-free nonprivacy invasive binary sensor data;Martino-Saltzman model;Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems project;Washington State University;cognitively normal elderly person monitoring;wireless passive infrared sensor data;MS travel pattern classifier algorithm;classical machine-learning classifier;travel pattern matching;time 21 month","","1","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The requirement of huge investment of time as well as money and risk of failure in clinical trials have led to surge in interest in drug repositioning. DR exploits two major aspects associated with drugs and diseases: existence of similarity among drugs and among diseases due to their shared involved genes or pathways or common biological effects. Existing methods of identifying drug-disease association majorly rely on the information available in the structured databases only. On the other hand, abundant information available in form of free texts in biomedical research articles are not being fully exploited. Word-embedding or obtaining vector representation of words from a large corpora of free texts using neural network methods have been shown to give significant performance for several natural language processing tasks. In this work we propose a novel way of representation learning to obtain features of drugs and diseases by combining complementary information available in unstructured texts and structured datasets. Next we use matrix completion approach on these feature vectors to learn projection matrix between drug and disease vector spaces. The proposed method has shown competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Further, the case studies on Alzheimer's and Hypertension diseases have shown that the predicted associations are matching with the existing knowledge.","","978-1-5386-2201-8978-1-5386-2202","10.1109/CYBConf.2017.7985802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7985802","","Drugs;Chemicals;Databases;Biology;Hypertension;Dementia","diseases;drugs;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;medical computing;natural language processing;neural nets;vectors","representation learning;drug repositioning;drug-disease association;word-embedding;word vector representation;neural network;natural language processing;matrix completion approach;feature vectors;projection matrix;disease vector spaces;Alzheimer's diseases;hypertension diseases","","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brain connectivity network inferred from fMRI data has been prevalently used to identify the individuals with MCI/AD from the normal controls (NCs). The capability to detect the causal or effective connectivity is highly desirable for understanding directed functional interactions between brain regions and further helping detection of MCI. In this paper, we proposed a novel sparse constrained effective connectivity inference method and an elastic multilayer perceptron classifier for MCI identification. Specifically, a ultra-group constrained structure detection algorithm is first designed to identify the parsimonious topology of the effective connectivity network, in which the weak derivatives of the observable data are considered. Second, based on the identified topology structure, an effective connectivity network is then constructed by using an ultra-orthogonal forward regression (UOFR) algorithm to minimize the shrinking effect of the group constraint-based method. Finally, the effective connectivity network is validated in MCI identification using an elastic multilayer perceptron classifier which extracts lower to higher level information from initial input features and hence improves the classification performance. Relatively high classification accuracy is achieved by the proposed method when compared to the state-of-the-art classification methods. Furthermore, the network analysis results demonstrate that MCI patients suffer a rich club effect loss and have decreased connectivity among several brain regions. These findings suggest that the proposed method not only improves the classification performance but also successfully discovers critical disease-related neuroimaging biomarkers.","0278-0062;1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2018.2882189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540933","Functional imaging;brain;computer-aided detection and diagnosis;connectivity analysis;machine learning","Feature extraction;Time series analysis;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Diseases;Multilayer perceptrons;Classification algorithms;Data mining","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The queried data is a semantic knowledge base containing the data on the program listings as well as detailed information on distinct program items. We explore two approaches to the entity modelling and entity search, the first is based on traditional information retrieval methods and is inspired by the recent developments in the field. The second methods exploit deeper query analysis, query mapping to entities of the underlying knowledge base and the graph topology exploration to identify answers to the input query. The evaluation of the two approaches shows that the second method outperforms the existing approach, having the mean average precision almost two times higher than the former one.

People with existing diagnosis of cognitive impairment go through episodic phases of dementia requiring different levels of care at different times. Monitoring the cognitive status of existing patients is, thus, critical to deciding the level of care required by older adults. In this paper, we present a system to assess the cognitive status of older adults by monitoring a common activity of daily living, namely handwashing. Specifically, we extract features from handwashing trials of participants diagnosed with different levels of dementia ranging from cognitively intact to severe cognitive impairment, as assessed by the mini-mental state exam (MMSE). Based on videos of handwashing trials, we extract two classes of features: one characterizing the occupancy of different sink regions by the participant, and the other capturing the path tortuosity of the motion trajectory of participant's hands. We perform correlation analysis to assess univariate capacity of individual features to predict MMSE scores. To assess multivariate performance, we use machine learning methods to train models that predict the cognitive status (aware, mild, moderate, severe), as well as the MMSE scores. We present results demonstrating that features derived from hand washing behavior can be potential surrogate markers of a person's dementia, which can be instrumental in developing automated tools for continuously monitoring the cognitive status of older adults.","2168-2194;2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2413358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061421",";Computer vision;dementia;hand washing;mini-mental state exam (MMSE);pervasive health;smart home monitoring;video analysis","Dementia;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Correlation;Trajectory;Fractals","cognition;computer vision;geriatrics;learning (artificial intelligence);neurophysiology","automated video analysis;handwashing behavior;cognitive health;cognitive impairment;older adults;minimental state exam;correlation analysis;machine learning","Cognitive Dysfunction;Hand Disinfection;Health Behavior;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Psychological Tests;Video Recording","11","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Cross-correlating a discovered model with information in the log can be used to improve the underlying process. However, existing process discovery techniques have two important drawbacks. The produced models tend to be large and complex, especially in flexible environments where process executions involve multiple alternatives. This “overload” of information is caused by the fact that traditional discovery techniques construct procedural models explicitly showing all possible behaviours. Moreover, existing techniques offer limited possibilities to guide the mining process towards specific properties of interest. These problems can be solved by discovering declarative models. Using a declarative model, the discovered process behaviour is described as a (compact) set of rules. Moreover, the discovery of such models can easily be guided in terms of rule templates. This paper uses DECLARE, a declarative language that provides more flexibility than conventional procedural notations such as BPMN, Petri nets, UML ADs, EPCs and BPEL. We present an approach to automatically discover DECLARE models. This has been implemented in the process mining tool ProM. Our approach and toolset have been applied to a case study provided by the company Thales in the domain of maritime safety and security.","","978-1-4244-9927-4978-1-4244-9926-7978-1-4244-9925","10.1109/CIDM.2011.5949297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949297","","Semantics;Unified modeling language;PROM;Security;Data mining;Monitoring;Safety","data mining","user guided discovery;declarative process model;process mining techniques;process discovery techniques;declarative models discovery;declarative language;automatically discover DECLARE models","","46","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The varying lengths of a query translate to the number of core concepts that may exist and the possibility of there being multiple query intents embedded within a single query. On the other hand, the structure of queries reveals the linguistic properties which allows for the determination of whether they take the form of well-formed sentences or are simply bags-of-words which in the strictest sense are a series of words with no obvious relations amongst them.

Early diagnosis of dementia helps in finding suitable therapies that reduce or even prevent further deterioration of patients' cognitive abilities. MRI scans are shown to be the most effective strategy to enable early diagnosis of dementia. Nevertheless, the early diagnosis of dementia is a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of MRI scans that may degrade the effectiveness of machine learning models. Feature abstraction is a part of dimensionality reduction process need by researchers to represent input data in its simplest form that results in a more-robust system model. It is a technique that collects relevant features and ignores irrelevant or redundant ones from data without loss of much key information. This paper proposes a novel feature abstraction method using sparse autoencoder (SAE) to reduce the dimensionality of and extract key features from MRI neuroimages. These features and that obtained from the popular PCA approach are then used to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression classifiers in order to compare their prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed approach yields higher classification accuracy compared to that using the PCA by 8 percent of classification accuracy. The experimental results show that the use of features learned by SAE in early diagnosis of multi-type dementia provides better classification performance than the use of raw image pixel intensities for diagnosing dementia.","","978-1-5386-1645-1978-1-5386-1644-4978-1-5386-1646","10.1109/SMC.2017.8123168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8123168","Dimensionality Reduction;Early diagnosis of Dementia;Feature abstraction;Machine learning;PCA;Sparse Autoencoder","Dementia;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Principal component analysis;Training;Image edge detection","biomedical MRI;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;patient diagnosis;principal component analysis;regression analysis","sparse auto-encoder;MRI scans;machine learning models;feature abstraction method;dementia diagnosis;dimensionality reduction;dementia multitype detection;feature extraction;MRI neuroimages;SAE;PCA approach;linear discriminant analysis;LDA;Logistic Regression classifiers;classification accuracy;raw image pixel intensities","","1","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to simplify the activity detection process, in ActiveLife, we adopt the context-based approach to model the common activities performed by the user within a day. Since the accelerometer and gyroscope are tri-axial sensors, the sensor data for different axes can be used to predict the current posture of the user while he is performing an activity. Combining with the heading direction of the posture obtained from the magnetometer and distance travelled during the transition of activities, we can estimate the current activity of the user.

"Symbolic Model Extraction for Web Application Verification","I. Bocic; T. Bultan","NA; NA","2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","","2017","","","724","734","Modern web applications use complex data models and access control rules which lead to data integrity and access control errors. One approach to find such errors is to use formal verification techniques. However, as a first step, most formal verification techniques require extraction of a formal model which is a difficult problem in itself due to dynamic features of modern languages, and it is typically done either manually, or using ad hoc techniques. In this paper, we present a technique called symbolic model extraction for extracting formal data models from web applications. The key ideas of symbolic model extraction are 1) to use the source language interpreter for model extraction, which enables us to handle dynamic features of the language, 2) to use code instrumentation so that execution of each instrumented piece of code returns the formal model that corresponds to that piece of code, 3) to instrument the code dynamically so that the models of methods that are created at runtime can also be extracted, and 4) to execute both sides of branches during instrumented execution so that all program behaviors can be covered in a single instrumented execution. We implemented the symbolic model extraction technique for the Rails framework and used it to extract data and access control models from web applications. Our experiments demonstrate that symbolic model extraction is scalable and extracts formal models that are precise enough to find bugs in real-world applications without reporting too many false positives.","1558-1225","978-1-5386-3868-2978-1-5386-3869","10.1109/ICSE.2017.72","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7985708","Formal Verification;Model Extraction;Web Applications","Instruments;Feature extraction;Data models;Data mining;Rails;Runtime;Load modeling","authorisation;data integrity;formal verification","symbolic model extraction technique;program behaviors;source language interpreter;formal verification techniques;access control rules;complex data models;Web application verification","","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their range of HDS-R scores were 0 to18. We obtained informed consent from subjects and their family. The experimental protocol used in this study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Kawasaki University. Salivary amylase activities were measured by the device of α-Amy Type 2.0 (Yamaha Co. LTD) and analyzed before and after occurrence daily activities. It was reported that salivary amylase activity correctly reacts to conditions of stress, via sympathetic-nervous-adrenomedullary system. We focused on their behavior or expressions and their reaction to others. Also it was analyzed the relations between their behavior and measured salivary amylase activities. In general, subjects' salivary amylase activities were increased, when they received rehabilitation, failed to communicate with the other elderly, their children and staff, estimated to participate the recreations and the busy bathing.

In reality, real world conversations with humans require support for dynamically capturing users expressions. Moreover, bots will derive immeasurable value by programming them to invoke APIs for their results. Today, within the Web and Mobile development community, complex applications are being stringed together with a few lines of code - all made possible by APIs. Yet, developers today are not as empowered to program bots in much the same way. To overcome this, we introduce BotBase, a bot programming platform that dynamically synthesizes natural language user expressions into API invocations.

To document and share proven architectural design decisions, decisions made in concrete development projects are mined and distilled into reusable architectural decision models (a.k.a. guidance models). The available distillation approaches, however, remain ad hoc and biased towards the personal experience of few expert architects. Relationships between distilled decisions are not systematically explored. We propose an approach for distilling reusable architectural design decisions with emphasis on their relationships. Architectural knowledge artifacts (e.g., architecture documentation, interviews) are systematically coded for the occurrence of architectural design decisions and their details. Co-occurrences of coded design decisions are then processed for different relationship types using an established data-mining technique: frequent item-sets. The distilled relationships enter the construction of a reusable architectural decision model and contribute to organizing the design space based on empirical data (i.e., frequency patterns of co-occurrences). We report on distilling design-decision relationships from decision data collected during a three-year project on language architectures of 80 UML-based domain-specific modeling languages.","","978-1-5090-2131-4978-1-5090-2563","10.1109/WICSA.2016.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7516812","architectural design decision;design-decision relationship;reusable architectural design-decision model;guidance model","Encoding;Computer architecture;Systematics;Software;Documentation;Decision making;Context","data mining;software architecture","guidance model;data-mining;architectural knowledge artifact;distilled decision;software architecture;frequent item-sets;reusable architectural decision model","","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The spread of smart phones and gadgets helps simplify the accessibility to Twitter and thus, increases the popularity overtime. In Twitter, users follow other users whom they are interested in their social contributions “tweets”. At many occasions, users resort to go over other user's tweets to decide if the user is interesting enough to follow. Clearly, doing this manually does not scale when there are many suggested users to be followed. Thus, it would be very useful if there is a tool that would automatically profile users and extract different characteristics of them. In this paper, we target one sort of Twitter Profiling problem by attempting to extract the interests/topics of the user behind the tweets. Building an automatic interest/topic categorization tool would be helpful for users and companies alike. For users, it makes the decision to follow a user way easier for them as it gives them an easy way to know the topics of the accounts which could be an important factor when following. For companies, it gives them further information about the Twitter users, which could lead to sending relevant targeted ads or marketing related items. We devise a machine-learning based topics-classification technique of Twitter users from merely their tweets. We target tweets that are in the Arabic language with Saudi dialect. Our technique achieves an accuracy of 90%.","","978-1-5386-4110-1978-1-5386-4111","10.1109/NCG.2018.8593031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8593031","Twitter;User Interest Modeling;Arabic Language","Twitter;Support vector machines;Text categorization;Sports;Blogs;Biological system modeling","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online)","Twitter users;Arabic Twitter Profiling;Arabic-speaking users;social network;interest categorization tool;topic categorization tool;Kingdom of Saudi Arabia;smart phones;machine learning;topics classification","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose to use this formalism as an indexing language to represent the descriptive concepts and their weighting. These concepts represent the content of the document. Our contribution is based on two steps; we propose, in the first step, the extraction of index terms using the multilingual lexical resource EuroWordNet (EWN). In the second step, we pass from the representation of index terms to the representation of index concepts through conceptual network formalism. This latter is generated using the EWN resource and the association rules model (in attempt to discover the non taxonomic relations or contextual relations between the concepts of a document). These lasts are latent relations, buried in the text, and carried by the semantic context of the co-occurrence of concepts in the document. The proposed approach can be applied to several languages because it builds a linguistic and statistical process. This approach is validated by a set of experiments and comparison with other methods of indexing based on a corpus of TREC evaluation campaign 2001 and 2002 of the ad hoc task. We prove that the proposed indexing approach provides encouraging results.","","978-1-5090-0626-7978-1-5090-0625-0978-1-5090-0627","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737996","concept extraction;statistical measures;multilingual documents;semantic indexing;conceptual network formalism;association rules;multilingual EuroWordNet","Semantics;Indexing;Information retrieval;Context;Computer science;Context modeling","data mining;indexing;natural language processing;statistical analysis;text analysis","semantic indexing;statistical method;multilingual text documents;conceptual network formalism;indexing language;descriptive concepts;index term extraction;multilingual lexical resource;EuroWordNet;index terms representation;EWN resource;association rule model;nontaxonomic relations;contextual relations;statistical process;TREC evaluation campaign","","2","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we use a graph-based approach to represent the shape of the brain, including the shape of the ventricular system and shape relative to the skull. This graph representation is applied to classification of individuals based on level of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease, level of education, and gender. The portions of the graph which are important to each distinction are found and visualized as an overlay on structural magnetic resonance images (MRI). We find that whole-brain analysis in this manner allows automatic classification of images based on gender if the whole brain is included, but not strictly based on the ventricular system. Alzheimer's Disease is found to strongly affect ventricle shape. Education is found to correlate with the shape of the medial longitudinal fissure and the Sylvian fissure, which may be due to increases in overall brain mass due to education. Gender is predicted primarily by information in the MRI regarding facial structure and head shape. Finally, age is found to be easier to classify than any of the above distinctions. The classifier is found to have 90.9% accuracy differentiating scans of individuals 40 and younger from those of individuals 60 or older.","","978-1-4673-1191-5978-1-4673-1190-8978-1-4673-1189","10.1109/CIBCB.2012.6217249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6217249","MRI;SVM;Graph Mining;Subgraph Discovery","Accuracy;Alzheimer's disease;Shape;Education;Correlation;Support vector machines;Magnetic resonance imaging","biomedical MRI;brain;data mining;diseases;graph theory;knowledge representation;medical computing;neurophysiology;pattern classification","graph based MRI brain scan classification;MRI brain scan correlation discovery;human brain shape;graph based approach;ventricular system shape;skull;graph representation;cognitive impairment;Alzheimer disease;educational level;gender;magnetic resonance images;whole brain analysis;medial longitudinal fissure;Sylvian fissure;brain mass;facial structure;head shape","","1","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the problem of converting an end-user's natural language input to a valid structured query in an ad-hoc fashion hasn't been sufficiently solved yet. In this paper we present a framework for Q&A systems that operate on structured data. The main innovation is that the framework allows defining a mapping between recognized semantics of a user's questions to a structured query model that can be executed on arbitrary data sources. It bases on popular standards like RDF and SparQL and is therefore very easy to adapt to other domains or use-cases. We will describe the application of this framework at hand of a BI question answering use-case, which also includes the personalization of generated queries, demonstrating the realworld applicability of our approach.

To realize the iSA, we also present a modular architecture, named intelligence operating architecture (iOA), capable of implementing all aspects of InT along with a biologically-inspired thought process. As a novel implementation platform for the iSA, we present user-centered development of robots enacted through agent based modularization (UDREAM). The effectiveness of UDREAM is shown through some application-specific experiments with individual robots.

In this paper, we derive clicked pages from clicked domains and use the surrounding query context to enhance retrieval performance. One strategy is to promote clicked pages directly in the initial retrieval result. Another strategy is to expand the original query using selected terms from the clicked pages. Our experimental results on the TREC GOV2 data and a query log of a major search engine show that both strategies can boost retrieval performance compared to the standard language model and pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) model.

However, these changes might be subtle particularly in patients with early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI). Hence, developing accurate diagnostic techniques for eMCI identification is critical for early intervention to prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). There is a large body of machine-learning-based research developed for classifying different brain states (e.g., AD vs MCI) using neuroimaging data. These works can be fundamentally grouped into two categories. The first one uses<italic>correlational</italic>methods, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its variants, with the aim to identify most correlated features for diagnosis. The second one includes<italic>discriminative</italic>methods, such as feature selection methods and linear discriminative analysis (LDA) and its variants to identify brain features that discriminate between two brain states. However, existing methods examine these correlational and discriminative brain data<italic>independently</italic>, which overlooks the complementary information provided by both techniques, which could prove to be useful in data classification tasks. On the other hand, how early dementia affects cortical brain<italic>connections in morphology</italic>remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a cooperative correlational and discriminative ensemble learning framework for eMCI diagnosis that leverages a brain network representation from multiple morphological networks, each derived from the cortical surface.

Recently proposed approaches to bug localization and feature location have suggested using the positional proximity of words in the source code files and the bug reports to determine the relevance of a file to a query. Two different types of approaches have emerged for incorporating word proximity and order in retrieval: those based on ad-hoc considerations and those based on Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. In this paper, we explore using both these types of approaches to identify over 200 features in five open source Java systems. In addition, we use positional proximity of query words within natural language (NL) phrases in order to capture the NL semantics of positional proximity. As expected, our results indicate that the power of these approaches varies from one dataset to another. However, the variations are larger for the ad-hoc positional-proximity based approaches than with the approach based on MRF. In other words, the feature location results are more consistent across the datasets with MRF based modeling of the features.","","978-1-4799-3752","10.1109/CSMR-WCRE.2014.6747185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747185","feature location;source code search;software maintenance","Natural languages;Information retrieval;Software maintenance;Markov random fields;Java;Semantics","Java;Markov processes;natural language processing;software maintenance","ad-hoc positional proximity;IR-based feature location;software maintenance;bug localization;word proximity;Markov random field;MRF modeling;Java system;query word;natural language semantics;NL semantics","","1","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, measuring positive tone requires the correct classification of sentences that are negated, i.e. The negation scopes. For example, around 4.74% of all sentences in German ad hoc announcements contain negations. To predict the corresponding negation scope, related literature commonly utilizes two approaches, namely, rule-based algorithms and machine learning. Nevertheless, a thorough comparison is missing, especially for the sentiment analysis of financial news. To close this gap, this paper uses German ad hoc announcements as a common example of financial news in order to pursue a two-sided evaluation. First, we compare the predictive performance using a manually-labeled dataset. Second, we examine how detecting negation scopes can improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis. In this instance, rule-based algorithms produce superior results, resulting in an improvement of up to 9.80% in the correlation between news sentiment and stock market returns.","1530-1605","978-1-4799-7367","10.1109/HICSS.2015.119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069923","","Hidden Markov models;Sentiment analysis;Prediction algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Speech;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling","knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;text analysis","financial news sentiment analysis enhancement;negation scope detection;source material polarity extraction;positive tone measurement;sentence classification;negated sentences;German ad-hoc announcements;rule-based algorithms;machine learning;two-sided evaluation;predictive performance;manually-labeled dataset;sentiment analysis accuracy improvement;stock market returns","","8","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis","X. Ou; S. R. Rajagopalan; S. Sakthivelmurugan","NA; NA; NA","2009 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference","","2009","","","494","503","Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful tools for automated intrusion analysis.","1063-9527","978-1-4244-5327-6978-0-7695-3919","10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706","intrusion detection;uncertainty;logic","Uncertainty;Intrusion detection;Humans;Data security;Computerized monitoring;Forensics;Computer security;Application software;Data mining;Production systems","inference mechanisms;security of data","uncertainty;system monitoring tools;intrusion detection system;malicious activities;logical language;automated reasoning process;system monitoring data;Datalog-like language;Prolog system;reasoning system;reasoning model;natural language description;Snort rule repository;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;ad hoc human reasoning;uncertain events;automated intrusion analysis","","9","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently an algorithm for feature selection, namely elastic net, was proposed allowing to deal with correlated genes in a transparent way. In this work we exploit the form of the output given by elastic net, as used in De Mol et al. (2007), to obtain a structured gene signature where genes are disposed in block of intra-correlated genes and the blocks are ranked according to a measure of the block discriminative power. After recalling how elastic net can be used to define nested lists of increasingly intra-correlated genes, we propose an ad hoc agglomerative clustering technique able to refine such a nested output by explicitly identifying modules of correlated genes. We take advantage of such a structure to visualize the correlation patterns underlying the data.

Although many studies have suggested that dual-task performance, in which participants perform a cognitive task while walking, is associated with cognition, they only considered the correlation between cognitive parameters and simple gait feature, such as gait speed, through the statistical analysis. We instead use a Kinect sensor to capture participants’ whole-body movements and extract a rich gait feature that has the ability to exhibit different tendencies of movements between healthy and cognitive-impaired elderlies. In our experiments, a classifier based on the dual-task gait feature achieved a higher performance than the one based on the single-task feature; the performance of the rich gait feature was better than that of a simple one, and; an optimal detection performance was achieved with an MMSE cutoff score of 25.

In this paper, we address the problem of developing scalable distributed algorithms for submodular maximization with a matroid constraint. Our key step is to construct an auxiliary function from the submodular objective function, and develop distributed exchange-based algorithms for optimizing the auxiliary function. We first introduce a distributed algorithm for maximizing a submodular function with a matroid constraint. We then develop an algorithm for maximizing time-varying submodular functions under partition matroid constraints, which arises in sensor placement and data caching.

However, written Ge'ez was kept firmly in use purely for sacred and scholarly endeavours, from the 13<sup>th</sup> to the 17<sup>th</sup> centuries, which is known as the “classical period” of Ethiopian literature. Ancient documents have great benefits for the modern world beyond cultural heritage. In recent years the digital archiving of ancient document is greatly expanding across the globe where ancient Ethiopian manuscripts written in Ge'ez language are beginning to appear in digital libraries and on the web. However, most of the documents are stored as raw images and they are not suitable for document processing and indexing. This reduces the usage of Ge'ez document in many research fields. Hence, there is a need for a recognition model that coverts raw images into machine encoded format. In the process of developing such a model, the document should be segmented into individual characters. The noise in old documents usually reduces the performance of many segmentation algorithms. This paper presents an image segmentation technique for the old Ge'ez handwritten documents. This segmentation technique outperforms the widely used watershed algorithm by 18.6% in terms of accuracy of segmentation. This will form part of the overall system for automatic optical character recognition for ancient Ge'ez handwritten documents.","","978-1-5386-7275-4978-1-5386-7274-7978-1-5386-7276","10.1109/CEEC.2018.8674218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8674218","Image segmentation;Ge’ez Ancient Ethiopian language;segmentation technique for Ge’ez documents","Image segmentation;Approximation algorithms;Image edge detection;Libraries;Optical character recognition software;Character recognition;History","digital libraries;document image processing;handwritten character recognition;history;image segmentation;natural language processing;optical character recognition","ancient Ethiopian Geez language;Ethiopia;spoken language;closely related tongues;sacred endeavours;scholarly endeavours;Ethiopian literature;ancient document;digital archiving;ancient Ethiopian manuscripts;digital libraries;document processing;indexing;old documents;segmentation algorithms;image segmentation technique;adaptive segmentation technique;digital manuscripts;raw images;ancient Ethiopian Ge'ez language;automatic optical character recognition;ancient Ge'ez handwritten documents;Roman alphabet","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our work focuses on benchmarking multiple SQL-like big data technologies over Hadoop based distributed file system (HDFS) for Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) used in clinical trial databases for improving the efficiency of research in clinical trials. We use publically available clinical trial data (from National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)), which follows SDTM, as a test bed to measure key parameters like usability, adaptability, modularity, robustness and efficiency of these solutions.

The nowadays popular discriminative (classification, machine learning, statistical forecasting etc.) approaches have been mostly abandoned while solving this task in spite of their success in a different task of text categorization. In this paper, we studied if a classifier can be trained solely based on labeled examples to successfully generalize to new (unseen by the system) queries and provide performance comparable with popular heuristic or language models. Our SVM-based classifier learns from the relevance judgments available with the standard test collections and generalizes to new, previously unseen queries its ability to compare and rank documents with respect to a given query. To accomplish this, we have designed a representation scheme, which is based on the discretized form of the high level statistics of the query term occurrences (such as tf, df, and document length) rather than individual terms. Using the standard metrics of average precision and the standard large and small test collections we confirmed that our machine learning approach can achieve the performance comparable with and better than the performance of the current state of the art models.","1530-1605","0-7695-2507","10.1109/HICSS.2006.252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1579395","","Information retrieval;Machine learning;Testing;Information systems;Text categorization;Space technology;Statistics;Management training;Appropriate technology;Support vector machines","","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach incorporates artificial life concepts, with a high-level architecture divided into three biologically inspired layers: cyber-physical, reactive, and deliberative. Each layer has a dynamic level of influence over the behavior of the agent. Algorithms within the layers act on a filtered view of reality, abstracted in the layer immediately below. Each layer takes input from the layer below, provides output to the layer above, and provides direction to the layer below. Fast-reactive control systems in lower layers ensure a stable environment supporting cognitive function on higher layers. The cyber-physical layer represents the central nervous system of the individual, consisting of elements of the vehicle that cannot be changed such as sensors, power plant, and physical configuration. On the reactive layer, the system uses an artificial life paradigm, where each agent interacts with the environment using a set of simple rules regarding wants and needs. Information is communicated explicitly via message passing and implicitly via observation and recognition of behavior. In the deliberative layer, individual agents look outward to the group, deliberating on efficient resource management and cooperation with other agents. Strategies at all layers are developed using machine learning techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) or NN applied to system training that takes place prior to the mission.","2155-7209","978-1-5386-0365-9978-1-5386-0366","10.1109/DASC.2017.8102147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8102147","Intelligent Systems;Neural Network;Genetic Algorithm","Genetic algorithms;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Sensors;Autonomous systems;Planning;Force","autonomous aerial vehicles;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots","multilayer model;swarm intelligence;resilient autonomous systems;Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University;Air Force Research Lab;intelligent adaptive adversaries;hostile environments;artificial life concepts;fast-reactive control systems;lower layers;stable environment;higher layers;cyber-physical layer;central nervous system;physical configuration;reactive layer;artificial life paradigm;deliberative layer;anti-access area denial environments;intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance task;machine learning techniques;genetic algorithm","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those papers have been analyzed and their contents classified according to the Classification Framework for Component Models proposed in our previous work. The results show that the main concerns handled by CPS component models are those of integration, performance, and maintainability. The instruments to satisfy those concerns, while architecting CPS, are ad-hoc software/system architecture, model-based approaches, architectural and component languages, and design. The IEC 61499 standard with its functions block is remarkably used to drive the work on six papers. Java is the most frequently used programming language used for implementing the components. Components are deployed mostly at compile time. Interfaces are almost equally distributed into port-based and operation-based. Overall, the results show a transition of technologies and approaches used in Embedded Systems to CPS, but still lacking methods for integrated architecting, in particular in incremental development.","","978-1-5090-2569","10.1109/CBSE.2016.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497427","Component-Based Software Engineering;Cyber-Physical Systems;Systematic Literature Review","Data mining;Software engineering;Protocols;Embedded systems;Cyber-physical systems;Systematics;Electronic mail","cyber-physical systems;embedded systems;IEC standards;Java;software architecture","component-based principles;component-based practices;cyber-physical systems;CPS;classification framework for component models;software architecture;system architecture;IEC 61499 standard;Java programming language;port-based components;operation-based components;embedded systems","","5","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
