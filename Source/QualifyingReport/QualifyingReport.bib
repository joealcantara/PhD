abstract = {The Global Observatory for Ageing and Dementia Care, hosted at the Health Service and Population Research Department, King's College London, was founded in 2013. Supported by Alzheimer's Disease International, and King's College London, the Observatory has a tripartite mission: 1. To build upon ADI's 10/66 Dementia Research Group program of population-based and intervention research in low and middle income countries, maximising the impact that research findings from our data can have upon policy and practice. 2. To develop, evaluate, and promote primary care and community interventions for people with dementia. 3. To synthesise global evidence for policymakers and public, in particular, continuing and developing our role in the preparation of high impact evidence-based reports for Alzheimer's Disease International (World Alzheimer Reports 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014, and Nutrition and dementia), the World Health Organization (Dementia: a public health priority, 2012) and other relevant intergovernmental organisations.

It thus constitutes a primary target for investigation of early markers of AD. Language deficits occur early in AD, and performance on verbal tasks is an important diagnostic criterion for both AD and MCI. We review language performance in MCI, compare these findings to those seen in AD, and identify the primary issues in understanding language performance in MCI and selecting tasks with diagnostic and prognostic value.},

	abstract = {Language assessment has a crucial role in the clinical diagnosis of several neurodegenerative diseases. The analysis of extended speech production is a precious source of information encompassing the phonetic, phonological, lexico-semantic, morpho-syntactic, and pragmatic levels of language organization. The knowledge about the distinctive linguistic variables identifying language deficits associated to different neurodegenerative diseases has progressively improved in the last years. However, the heterogeneity of such variables and of the way they are measured and classified limits any generalization and makes the comparison among studies difficult. Here we present an exhaustive review of the studies focusing on the linguistic variables derived from the analysis of connected speech samples, with the aim of characterizing the language disorders of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including primary progressive aphasia, Alzheimer's disease, movement disorders, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A total of 61 studies have been included, considering only those reporting group analysis and comparisons with a group of healthy persons. This review first analyzes the differences in the tasks used to elicit connected speech, namely picture description, story narration, and interview, considering the possible different contributions to the assessment of different linguistic domains. This is followed by an analysis of the terminologies and of the methods of measurements of the variables, indicating the need for harmonization and standardization. The final section reviews the linguistic domains affected by each different neurodegenerative disease, indicating the variables most consistently impaired at each level and suggesting the key variables helping in the differential diagnosis among diseases. While a large amount of valuable information is already available, the review highlights the need of further work, including the development of automated methods, to take advantage of the richness of connected speech analysis for both research and clinical purposes.},

The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the use of non-linear elements, like varactor diodes or variable capacitor or an inductor on iron core material in the transmission line model in Miller form to produce negative group delay. The reason for choosing the Miller form loading is the practical simplicity of realizing these transmission line models on microstrip. Two different types of loadings are considered in this paper, one with the non-linear capacitor and other with the non-linear inductor. The gain for a unit cell of this model is obtained and the group delay and phase delay has been analyzed. After the analysis, is observed that the non-linear elements can produce the opposite delays in the circuit models. {\textcopyright} Research India Publications.},

	abstract = {Semantic dementia (SD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are both disorders in which early pathology affects the temporal lobe yet they produce distinct syndromes of declarative memory impairment-loss of established semantic knowledge with relatively preserved episodic memory in the former and the converse in the latter. Groups with mild SD and mild AD who showed a double dissociation in these two aspects of declarative memory were studied-the SD group's episodic memory and the AD group's semantic knowledge each being comparable to controls. Positron emission tomography and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging were used to map deficits in regional cerebral metabolic rate and mesial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy, respectively. Episodic memory impairment in AD was associated with dysfunction of an integrated network (mesial temporal lobe, mamillary bodies, dorso-mesial thalamus and posterior cingulate). Semantic memory impairment in SD was associated with bilateral rostral temporal lobe hypometabolism. The SD group had comparable MTL atrophy and hypometabolism to that found in AD but the remainder of their limbic-diencephalic network was preserved suggesting that the latter explains their ability to acquire new episodic memories. The results challenge the view that amnesia in early AD can be explained by the degree of MTL damage alone while showing that semantic impairment can occur with damage restricted to the rostral temporal lobes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Our results support the hypothesis that signs of dementia can be found in diachronic analyses of patients' writings, and in addition lead to new understanding of the work of the individual authors whom we studied. In particular, we show that it is probable that Agatha Christie indeed suffered from the onset of Alzheimer's while writing her last novels, and that Iris Murdoch exhibited a ‘trough' of relatively impoverished vocabulary and syntax in her writing in her late 40s and 50s that presaged her later dementia.},

We compared the predictive validity of these scoring procedures for the identification of very mild prevalent dementia (CDR=0.5), of incident dementia, and for distinguishing Alzheimer Disease (AD) and nonAD dementias. We tested 244 elderly African American and White primary care patients at 18 month intervals using a screening neuropsychologic battery that included the FCSRT and a comprehensive diagnostic neuropsychologic battery. Median follow-up was 2.6 years. Dementia diagnoses were assigned using standard criteria without access to the results of the screening battery. There were 50 prevalent and 28 incident dementia cases. At scores selected to provide specificities of 90{\%}, free recall was more sensitive to incident and prevalent dementia than the other 2 measures. Patients with impaired free recall were 15 times more likely to have a prevalent dementia and their risk of future dementia was 4 times higher than patients with intact free recall. Neither race nor education affected prediction although older patients were at increased risk of future dementia. Total recall was more impaired in AD dementia than in nonAD dementias. The results indicate that using the FCSRT, free recall is the best measure for detecting prevalent dementia and predicting future dementia. Total recall impairment supports the diagnosis of AD rather than nonAD dementia.},

The detection rate of a sentinel lymph node and its dependence on the choice of lymphography technique, patient selection, and technical procedure were analysed.

The false-negative rate (FNR, overall: 8.2{\%}) was independent of patient selection and technical features. The FNR did not depend on experience in the application of the method, but seemed related to surgical accuracy to detect sentinel nodes. Compared to conventional staging procedures (palpation, ultrasound) SNB yielded highly reproducible results for the prediction of the axillary status even in a multicentre setting involving surgeons with different training status.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: SNB is suited as standard of care procedure.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if linguistic ability in early life is associated with cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease in late life. DESIGN: Two measures of linguistic ability in early life, idea density and grammatical complexity, were derived from autobiographies written at a mean age of 22 years. Approximately 58 years later, the women who wrote these autobiographies participated in an assessment of cognitive function, and those who subsequently died were evaluated neuropathologically. SETTING: Convents in the United States participating in the Nun Study; primarily convents in the Milwaukee, Wis, area. PARTICIPANTS: Cognitive function was investigated in 93 participants who were aged 75 to 95 years at the time of their assessments, and Alzheimer's disease was investigated in the 14 participants who died at 79 to 96 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seven neuropsychological tests and neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Low idea density and low grammatical complexity in autobiographies written in early life were associated with low cognitive test scores in late life. Low idea density in early life had stronger and more consistent associations with poor cognitive function than did low grammatical complexity. Among the 14 sisters who died, neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease was present in all of those with low idea density in early life and in none of those with high idea density. CONCLUSIONS: Low linguistic ability in early life was a strong predictor of poor cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease in late life.},

	abstract = {Objective: Progressive memory impairment is the primary cognitive feature of Alzheimer's disease. Systematic attention to progressive language impair-ment is under-appreciated. The purpose of this article is to apply the semiotic language framework to organize the disparate findings on language impairment in DAT. Method: The semiotic system is hierarchical, going from simple to more complex units of language, with the hierarchical ranks of phonol-ogy, morphology, syntax, semantics. This language hierarchy is used as an organizing tool to provide a context for the discrete data on language decline in DAT. Studies relating to language impairment in DAT were identified through an exhaustive computerized search (Medline and Psych Info Database) of available literature spanning the last forty years in which 615 references were examined. Papers were selected for review if reference were made to any one or more of the language parameters of phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, or to any components or indicators of these parameters, such as sound production, naming, grammar, sentence processing, verbal comprehen-sion in Alzheimer patients. Results: There appears to be an overall relation between language decline and complexity of language both across and within the hierarchical ranks. There also appears to be an associated negative relation between sequence in language development and language decline. Language forms learned last in the sequence of language development are the most complex and appear to be first to deteriorate. Conclusions: The decline of language in DAT appears to be hierarchical in nature. Further understand-ing of this hierarchical language decline depends in part on nosologic clarification and subtyping of DAT.},

The current study reports preliminary clinical validity results with the RBANS, comparing very mildly demented patients with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (n = 20) to patients with Huntington's disease (n = 20) and normal controls (n = 40). Although the patient groups had essentially identical total scores on the RBANS, they exhibited opposite profiles, differing significantly on four of the five subsections. The AD patients performed most poorly on Language, and Delayed Memory subsections, while the HD patients obtained their lowest scaled scores on the Attention and the Visuospatial/Constructional subsections. These results are consistent with the neuropsychological profiles of these dementing disorders derived from lengthier standardized tests and experimental investigations. In addition, even those patients who performed above the suggested cut-off points on the MMSE and the Dementia Rating Scale scored significantly below their controls on the RBANS. These data suggest that the RBANS is effective at both detecting and characterizing dementia of different etiologies.},

However, its ability to detect milder cognitive deficits in the elderly has not been examined. The current study examined the clinical utility of the RBANS by comparing two groups: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; n = 72) and cognitively intact peers (n = 71). Significant differences were observed on the RBANS Total score, 3 of the 5 Indexes, and 6 of the 12 subtests, with individuals with MCI performing worse than the comparison participants. Specificity was very good, but sensitivity ranged from poor to moderate. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the RBANS Immediate and Delayed Memory Indexes and the Total Scale score were adequate. Although significant differences were observed between groups and the areas under the curves were adequate, the lower sensitivity values of the RBANS suggests that caution should be used when diagnosing conditions such as MCI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Working memory (WM) is often assessed with serial order tests such as repeating digits backward. In prior dementia research using the Backward Digit Span Test (BDT), only aggregate test performance was examined. OBJECTIVE The current research tallied primacy/recency effects, out-of-sequence transposition errors, perseverations, and omissions to assess WM deficits in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS Memory clinic patients (n = 66) were classified into three groups: single domain amnestic MCI (aMCI), combined mixed domain/dysexecutive MCI (mixed/dys MCI), and non-MCI where patients did not meet criteria for MCI. Serial order/WM ability was assessed by asking participants to repeat 7 trials of five digits backwards. Serial order position accuracy, transposition errors, perseverations, and omission errors were tallied. RESULTS A 3 (group)×5 (serial position) repeated measures ANOVA yielded a significant group×trial interaction. Follow-up analyses found attenuation of the recency effect for mixed/dys MCI patients. Mixed/dys MCI patients scored lower than non-MCI patients for serial position 3 (p {\textless} 0.003) serial position 4 (p {\textless} 0.002); and lower than both group for serial position 5 (recency; p {\textless} 0.002). Mixed/dys MCI patients also produced more transposition errors than both groups (p {\textless} 0.010); and more omissions (p {\textless} 0.020), and perseverations errors (p {\textless} 0.018) than non-MCI patients. CONCLUSIONS The attenuation of a recency effect using serial order parameters obtained from the BDT may provide a useful operational definition as well as additional diagnostic information regarding working memory deficits in MCI.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In addition to episodic memory impairment, working memory may also be compromised in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's dementia (AD), but standard verbal and visuospatial span tasks do not always detect impairments. Objective: To examine whether more complex verbal and visuospatial working memory tasks result in more reliable impairment detection. Methods: The Digit Span (forward, backward and sequencing), Spatial Span (forward and backward) and Spatial Addition test from the Wechsler batteries were administered to MCI and AD patients and performance compared to healthy older adult controls. Results: Results showed that both the MCI and AD patients had impaired performance on the Spatial Addition test. Both groups also had impaired performance on all three Digit Span conditions, but no differences were found between forward and backward conditions in any of the groups. The sequencing condition differed from the backward condition only in the AD group. Spatial Span performance was impaired in AD group patients but not in MCI patients. Conclusion: Working memory deficits are evident in MCI and AD even on standard neuropsychological tests. However, available tests may not detect subtle impairments, especially in MCI. Novel paradigms tapping the episodic buffer component of working memory may be useful in the assessment of working memory deficits, but such instruments are not yet available for clinical assessment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is a powerful neuropsychological tool for testing episodic memory, which is widely used for the cognitive assessment in dementia and pre-dementia conditions. Several studies have shown that an impairment in RAVLT scores reflect well the underlying pathology caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus making RAVLT an effective early marker to detect AD in persons with memory complaints. We investigated the association between RAVLT scores (RAVLT Immediate and RAVLT Percent Forgetting) and the structural brain atrophy caused by AD. The aim was to comprehensively study to what extent the RAVLT scores are predictable based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data using machine learning approaches as well as to find the most important brain regions for the estimation of RAVLT scores. For this, we built a predictive model to estimate RAVLT scores from gray matter density via elastic net penalized linear regression model. The proposed approach provided highly significant cross-validated correlation between the estimated and observed RAVLT Immediate (R = 0.50) and RAVLT Percent Forgetting (R = 0.43) in a dataset consisting of 806 AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or healthy subjects. In addition, the selected machine learning method provided more accurate estimates of RAVLT scores than the relevance vector regression used earlier for the estimation of RAVLT based on MRI data. The top predictors were medial temporal lobe structures and amygdala for the estimation of RAVLT Immediate and angular gyrus, hippocampus and amygdala for the estimation of RAVLT Percent Forgetting. Further, the conversion of MCI subjects to AD in 3-years could be predicted based on either observed or estimated RAVLT scores with an accuracy comparable to MRI-based biomarkers.},

The author lists the necessary conditions for adequately testing these three points. The tests for differentiating acquired and constitutional deficiencies are usually categorized on the basis of whether they are dependent on the memory of the subject. Some types of tasks for differentiating these two types of deficiencies are (1) the solution of rolled-up figures, (2) copying of complex figures, (3) reproduction from memory of complex figures, and (4) classification of figures and memory of their position.

DESIGN AND SETTING longitudinal; Cardiovascular Health Study. SUBJECTS 5,888 participants (57.6{\%} women, 15.7{\%} black, 75.1 (5.5), mean years (SD)). METHODS psychomotor speed (Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)) and small vessel disease (white matter hyperintensities (WMH)) were measured in 1992-94. Global cognition (Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) examination), mobility (gait speed (GS)) and mood (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale) were measured annually over 5 years and classified as clinical, subclinical or no disorders based on established values (3MS: 80 and 85 points; GS: 0.6 and 1.0 m/s; CES-D: 10 and 5 points). Analyses were adjusted for demographics, baseline status, education, diabetes, hypertension, ankle-arm index. RESULTS among those with no disorder in cognition, mobility and mood (N = 619) in 1992-94, being in the lowest DSST quartile compared to the highest was associated with nearly twice the odds of developing 1+ clinical or subclinical disorders (N = 413) during follow-up. Associations were stronger for incident clinical disorders in cognition (OR: 8.44, p {\textless} 0.01) or mobility (OR: 9.09, p {\textless} 0.05) than for mood (OR: 1.88, p {\textless} 0.10). Results were similar after adjustment for WMH. CONCLUSIONS slower psychomotor speed may serve as a biomarker of risk of clinical disorders of cognition, mobility and mood. While in part attributable to vascular brain disease, other potentially modifiable contributors may be present. Further studying the causes of psychomotor slowing with ageing might provide novel insights into age-related brain disorders.},

Methods: Twelve patients with PD and normal cognition (PD-N), 11 with PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and 13 healthy participants (NC) controlled for age, sex and education were recruited. Results: PD-MCI participants achieved significantly lower scores than NC and PD-N participants. Eye-movement parameters, however, did not differ among the study groups, and were not correlated with task performance. Conclusions: Impaired performance on the SDMT by PD-MCI participants despite relatively preserved oculomotor performance indicates that lower SDMT scores are not due - even in part - to visuomotor impairments otherwise seen in PD patients.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 S.

	abstract = {A meta-analysis of 153 studies with 15,990 participants was conducted to compare the magnitude of deficits upon tests of phonemic and semantic fluency for patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) relative to healthy controls. As has been found for patients with focal temporal cortical lesions (but not for patients with focal frontal cortical lesions), DAT patients were significantly more impaired on tests of semantic relative to phonemic fluency (r=0.73 and 0.57, respectively). Thus, since phonemic and semantic fluency are considered to impose comparable demands upon executive control processes such as effortful retrieval, but the latter is relatively more dependent upon the integrity of semantic memory, these results suggest that the semantic memory deficit in DAT reflects a degradation of the semantic store. Also supporting this conclusion, confrontation naming, a measure of semantic memory that imposes only minimal demands upon effortful retrieval, was significantly more impaired than phonemic fluency (r=0.60 versus 0.55, respectively). However, since semantic fluency was also significantly more impaired than confrontation naming (r=0.73 versus 0.61), deficits in semantic memory and effortful retrieval may be additive. Semantic, but not phonemic fluency, was significantly more impaired than measures of verbal intelligence and psychomotor speed. Thus, the semantic memory deficit in DAT qualifies as a differential deficit, but executive dysfunction as indexed by phonemic fluency does not constitute an additional isolated feature of the disorder. Dementia severity was not significantly related to the relative magnitude of deficits upon phonemic and semantic fluency. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Impairments in semantic memory have been demonstrated to be a critical factor in early AD. The Boston Naming Test (BNT) is a straightforward method of examining semantic or visuo-perceptual processing and therefore represents a potential diagnostic tool. The objective of this study was to examine naming ability and identify error types in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Methods: Twenty aMCI patients, twenty AD patients and twenty-one normal controls, matched by age, sex and education level were evaluated. As part of a further neuropsychological evaluation, all subjects performed the BNT. A comprehensive classification of error types was devised in order to compare performance and ascertain semantic or perceptual origin of errors. Results: AD patients obtained significantly lower total scores on the BNT than aMCI patients and controls. aMCI patients did not obtain significant differences in total scores, but showed significantly higher semantic errors compared to controls. Conclusion: This study reveals that semantic processing is impaired during confrontation naming in aMCI.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Each patient underwent a clinical assessment packet and a series of neuropsychological tests of the language and constructional praxis subtests of Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMGOG) and the Boston naming test (BNT), at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Educational levels were defined taking into account the total years of education, the school level, and diplomas. MCI patients with low education level showed a stepwise reduction in scores of naming objects (NO; P = 0.009), definition (DF; P = 0.012), language (LT; P = 0.021), constructional praxis (CD; P = 0.022), confrontation naming skills (BXB; P = 0.033), phonemic help (BFB; P = 0.041), and BNT (P = 0.002). Analysis of covariance, controlling for baseline scores, showed that education was associated with NO score (P = 0.002), DF score (P = 0.005), LT (P = 0.008), CD score (P = 0.008), BXB score (44.36 ± 1.84, P = 0.0001), BFB (P = 0.022), and BNT (P = 0.004). Our findings indicate that education appeared to affect verbal and nonverbal task performance in MCI patients. Despite the fact that higher educated patients are more acquainted with the tasks, slower deterioration in consecutive follow-up examinations could be explained by the cognitive reserve theory. The potential association of this protective effect with delayed onset of symptoms deserves further investigation.},

	abstract = {Objective The immediate copy of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) is considered a visuo-spatial test. However, reproducing this complex structure possibly involves also executive functions, such as planning and organizational strategies. In a previous study, we found a high rate of impaired performances in this test in a sample of subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment patients. Executive functions contribution in the immediate copy of the ROCF can be assessed with the Boston Qualitative Scoring System (BQSS). We aimed at examining whether BQSS executive scores of ROCF immediate copy: (1) differ between vascular (v-MCI) and degenerative MCI (d-MCI) patients; (2) can at least partly explain the high rate of abnormal ROCF immediate copy performances in v-MCI patients. Method Thirty d-MCI patients (age 75.2 ± 4.4) and 27 v-MCI (age 73.2 ± 6.9) were enrolled. The performances of patients were scored using the BQSS executive scores (Fragmentation, Planning, Organization, Perseveration) during the accomplishment of ROCF immediate copy. Results Comparing d-MCI and v-MCI performances, d-MCI patients scored worse on ROCF delayed recall (9.9 ± 4.7 vs. 13.4 ± 5.9, p = .020) and MMSE (23.9 ± 2.6 vs. 27.8 ± 2.3, p = .001) while v-MCI patients had more frequently impaired performances in ROCF immediate copy (40{\%} vs. 81{\%}, p = .001) and showed worse scores on Fragmentation (2.4 ± 0.9 vs. 1.8 ± 1.3, p = .035), Planning (2.4 ± 0.8 vs. 1.8 ± 1, p = .039), Organization (4.8 ± 1.3 vs. 3.6 ± 2.1, p = .017), and Perseveration (3.5 ± 0.8 vs. 2.9 ± 1.2, p = .048). Conclusions The performance of v-MCI patients in ROCF immediate copy seemed to be more affected by executive dysfunction than the performance obtained by d-MCI. When analyzing ROCF performances, a qualitative approach allows to evaluate patients' strategies during the reproduction, and thus to discriminate between executive and visuo-constructional abilities.},

	abstract = {The ability to inhibit irrelevant information is essential for coping with the demands of everyday life. Inhibitory deficits are present in all stages of dementia and commonly observed in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Inhibition is frequently tested with the Stroop test, but this may lack ecological validity. This study investigates inhibitory control in people with Alzheimer's disease dementia (PwD) and PwPD using the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT), which aspires to be a more ecologically valid task. A total of 117 people completed the HSCT, a test where participants have to complete a sentence with an unrelated word. The sample comprised 30 PwD, 33 PwPD, and 54 healthy older controls. We compared response times and the number and type of errors across the three groups. Completion time in Part B (Inhibition) did not distinguish between PwD, PwPD, and controls when controlling for the initiation speed, but a higher proportion of Category A errors (producing a word that fits the sentence when instructed otherwise) was a unique characteristic of inferior performance in PwD and PwPD. While not part of the standard test scoring protocol, controlling for the initiation speed and distinguishing between speed and accuracy in test performance appear to be essential for accurate evaluation of the inhibitory control in HSCT in older people. The findings suggest that the HSCT may be sensitive to verbal suppression deficits and may provide insight into inhibitory control in PwD and PwPD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Early identification of individuals at high risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases is essential for timely preventive intervention. However, simple methods that can be used for risk assessment in general practice are lacking. METHODS Within the population-based Rotterdam Study, we used the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT) to assess manual dexterity in 4,856 persons (median age 70 years, 58{\%} women) free of parkinsonism and dementia between 2000 and 2004. We followed these persons until January 1, 2012 for the onset of neurodegenerative diseases (defined as first diagnosis of parkinsonism or dementia). We determined the association of PPT scores with incident neurodegenerative disease, adjusting for age, sex, study cohort, level of education, smoking, preferred hand, parental history, memory complaints, and Mini-Mental State Examination. Furthermore, we determined the incremental predictive value of PPT, expressed as change in risk classification and discrimination. RESULTS During follow-up (median 9.2 years), 277 participants were diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease (227 with dementia and 50 with parkinsonism). Lower PPT scores were associated with higher risk of incident neurodegenerative diseases (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-1.41) and improved discrimination of incident neurodegenerative diseases. We also observed significant associations of PPT scores separately with incident dementia (HR = 1.25; 95{\%} CI: 1.14-1.39]) and incident parkinsonism (HR = 1.41; 95{\%} CI: 1.19-1.67). CONCLUSIONS A rapid, nonlaboratory test of manual dexterity may help to identify persons at high risk for neurodegenerative diseases. This highlights the importance of motor function in the preclinical phase of both dementia and parkinsonism and may aid in selecting individuals for refined screening and neuroprotective trials.},

Patients with AD and with MCI exhibited a significant detriment in visual search performance compared to the older adult controls. The deficit in visual search was greater for the patients with AD than the patients with MCI.

	abstract = {Objective: To identify qualitative and quantitative differences among the connected speech productions of patients with non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (naPPA), logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA), and semantic variant PPA (svPPA). Background: The core diagnostic features of naPPA are effortful, non-fluent speech and impaired production and comprehension of grammar. Patients with svPPA have a prominent impairment of semantics. lvPPA patients exhibit impaired word retrieval and slowed speech, without the conspicuous agrammatism seen in naPPA. We used a brief speech sample to differentiate among these groups. Design/Methods: We studied patients with nfaPPA (n=15), lvPPA (n=29), svPPA (n=11), behavioral-variant FTD (n=17), and healthy seniors (n=12). Up to 90 seconds of speech was recorded while subjects described the Cookie Theft scene. The recordings were transcribed and coded for fluency, grammar, and lexicon, employing well-defined, easily applied criteria. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of structural MRI images was available for a subset of PPA patients. Results: Patients with naPPA exhibited a dramatically reduced speech rate, produced the largest number of speech-sound errors, and exhibited the least grammatical complexity of all groups. lvPPA patients made few speech-sound errors, but they exhibited other disruptions to the flow of speech and also produced ungrammatical and incomplete sentences, with impaired lexical access. The only prominent impairment in svPPA was of lexical access. VBM analysis revealed a relation of slowed speech rate to left middle and inferior frontal regions and insula in naPPA and to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior portions of middle and superior temporal gyri in lvPPA. Lexical impairments were related to temporal regions in svPPA. Conclusions: PPA patient groups differ qualitatively on measures of fluency, grammar, and lexical retrieval, which may help distinguish them. Their speech impairments are associated with atrophy in different portions of a left hemisphere language network.},

	abstract = {In the early stages of neurodegenerative disorders, individuals may exhibit a decline in language abilities that is difficult to quantify with standardized tests. Careful analysis of connected speech can provide valuable information about a patient's language capacities. To date, this type of analysis has been limited by its time-consuming nature. In this study, we present a method for evaluating and classifying connected speech in primary progressive aphasia using computational techniques. Syntactic and semantic features were automatically extracted from transcriptions of narrative speech for three groups: semantic dementia (SD), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and healthy controls. Features that varied significantly between the groups were used to train machine learning classifiers, which were then tested on held-out data. We achieved accuracies well above baseline on the three binary classification tasks. An analysis of the influential features showed that in contrast with controls, both patient groups tended to use words which were higher in frequency (especially nouns for SD, and verbs for PNFA). The SD patients also tended to use words (especially nouns) that were higher in familiarity, and they produced fewer nouns, but more demonstratives and adverbs, than controls. The speech of the PNFA group tended to be slower and incorporate shorter words than controls. The patient groups were distinguished from each other by the SD patients' relatively increased use of words which are high in frequency and/or familiarity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The influences of relaxation times and chemical shift upon image quality and signal-to-noise ratio are highlighted, and power deposition is introduced as a significant factor which may limit the flexibility and information available at higher fields as long as 180 degrees echo pulses continue to be necessary. Chemical-shift imaging is examined and found wanting as a means of coping with chemical-shift artifacts, and the use of multiple echoes (albeit with research) in conjunction with multiple-slice techniques is advocated as representing an efficient data-gathering scheme which can improve image signal-to-noise ratio. With such use, a medium field strength (0.5-1 T) is presented as representing, for general purpose imaging of head and torso, the best current compromise when imaging time is of major importance, with the important caveat that new techniques may always invalidate this conclusion.},

	abstract = {Introduction Trials in Alzheimer's disease are increasingly focusing on prevention in asymptomatic individuals. We hypothesized that indicators of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be present in the content of spoken language in older adults and be useful in distinguishing those with MCI from those who are cognitively intact. To test this hypothesis, we performed linguistic analyses of spoken words in participants with MCI and those with intact cognition participating in a clinical trial. Methods Data came from a randomized controlled behavioral clinical trial to examine the effect of unstructured conversation on cognitive function among older adults with either normal cognition or MCI (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01571427). Unstructured conversations (but with standardized preselected topics across subjects) were recorded between interviewers and interviewees during the intervention sessions of the trial from 14 MCI and 27 cognitively intact participants. From the transcription of interviewees recordings, we grouped spoken words using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a structured table of words, which categorizes 2500 words into 68 different word subcategories such as positive and negative words, fillers, and physical states. The number of words in each LIWC word subcategory constructed a vector of 68 dimensions representing the linguistic features of each subject. We used support vector machine and random forest classifiers to distinguish MCI from cognitively intact participants. Results MCI participants were distinguished from those with intact cognition using linguistic features obtained by LIWC with 84{\%} classification accuracy which is well above chance 60{\%}. Discussion Linguistic analyses of spoken language may be a powerful tool in distinguishing MCI subjects from those with intact cognition. Further studies to assess whether spoken language derived measures could detect changes in cognitive functions in clinical trials are warrented.},

	abstract = {English texts were constructed from propositional bases. One set of 16-$\backslash$nword sentences was obtained from semantic bases containing from 4 to 9$\backslash$nproposition;. For another set of sentences and paragraphs, number of words$\backslash$nand number of propositions covaried. Subjects read the texts at their own$\backslash$nrate and recalled them immediately. For the 16-word sentences, subjects$\backslash$nneeded 1.5 set additional reading time to process each proposition. For$\backslash$nlonger texts, this value increased. In another experimental condition reading$\backslash$ntime was controlled by the experimenter. The analysis of both the text$\backslash$nand the recall protocols in terms of number of propositions lent support to$\backslash$nthe notion that propositions are a basic unit of memory for text. However,$\backslash$nevidence was also obtained that while the total number of propositions upon$\backslash$nwhich a text was based proved to be an effective psychological variable, all$\backslash$npropositions were not equally difficult to remember: superordinate propositions$\backslash$nwere recalled better than propositions which were stucturally subordinate.$\backslash$nConsiderable experimental evidence exists today indicating that sentences,$\backslash$nand prose material in general, are not stored in memory verbatim,$\backslash$nbut are coded as to their content (Sachs, 1967; Bransford {\&} Franks, 1971;$\backslash$nKintsch {\&} Monk, 1972). While such findings agree very well with our$\backslash$nintuitions, they do not help us determine precisely in what way content$\backslash$nis coded in memory. Since the general problem is extremely complex,$\backslash$nno general theory of text memory has yet been formulated. Such a theory$\backslash$nwould be required to consider numerous properties of a text. For example,$\backslash$na sentence presents some new information in a given context,$\backslash$nsituational or verbal; a part of a sentence or paragraph must be identified$\backslash$nas the theme; there are grammatical relations among the elements of$\backslash$na sentence; and finally, each text has a logical structure.

Textual and communicative aspects will be neglected,$\backslash$neven though they are undoubtedly of great psycholinguistic significance.$\backslash$nA number of theories have recently been developed concerning the$\backslash$nlogical structure of text and, closely related, the nature of semantic memory.$\backslash$nSeveral linguists have explored the idea that sentences have a base$\backslash$nstructure consisting of propositions which represent their semantic content.$\backslash$nKintsch (1972) has shown how one could conceive of semantic$\backslash$nmemory as being constructed from such propositional expressions. In the$\backslash$npresent paper an attempt is made to show that the propositional base$\backslash$nstructure of a sentence, as postulated by Kintsch ( 1972), has predictable$\backslash$nempirical effects upon behavior. Such a demonstration is of crucial$\backslash$nimportance if the speculations that have been offered about semantic$\backslash$nmemory are to be taken seriously as a psychological model.$\backslash$nThis initial experiment was designed to determine whether the number$\backslash$nof propositions in the base structure of a sentence is an important$\backslash$npsychological variable. In particular, sentences which differed in the$\backslash$nnumber of underlying propositions, but which were equal in terms of total$\backslash$nnumber of words, were given to subjects to read and to recall immediately$\backslash$nafter reading. A second set of sentences and paragraphs, in which number$\backslash$nof words and number of propositions covaried, was also used in order$\backslash$nto study number of propositions over a wider range. With the number of$\backslash$nwords per sentence controlled, propositions varied from 4 to 9; with$\backslash$nthe second set of sentences propositions varied from 2 to 23. If number$\backslash$nof propositions is an effective psychological variable, reading time should$\backslash$nincrease as more propositions are processed; likewise, the number of$\backslash$npropositions subjects are able to recall should be related to processing$\backslash$ntime in a lawful way. Of course, by averaging over all kinds of different$\backslash$npropositions and looking only at the effect of the total number of$\backslash$npropositions, many potentially significant sources of variance are being$\backslash$nneglected. In addition to the mere number of propositions, the nature$\backslash$nand number of their arguments, their complexity, structural relations$\backslash$namong them, lexical factors, and many other properties might be important$\backslash$ndeterminants of reading speed and comprehensibility. In$\backslash$nthe studies reported here, a11 of these factors vary unsystematically. Thus,$\backslash$nthe difficulty that each proposition presents is certainly not a constant,$\backslash$nbut a random variable with an appreciable variance. Nevertheless, as$\backslash$nlong as one deals with averages, the number of propositions upon which$\backslash$na text is based should have a strong and significant effect, if the proposition$\backslash$nis indeed a proper unit of analysis for studies concerned with the$\backslash$nprocessing and storage of linguistic information.$\backslash$nSome subjects were allowed to study each sentence or paragraph as$\backslash$nlong as they wanted; their reading time was one of the major dependent$\backslash$nPROPOSITIONAL BASE AND READING 259$\backslash$nvariables of interest for the present study. Other subjects, however, were$\backslash$ngiven only a limited reading time. Their recall was compared with that$\backslash$nof unrestricted subjects, and a processing model that captures some of$\backslash$nthe most salient features of both sets of data was developed.$\backslash$nMETHOD$\backslash$nSubjects. In the free reading time condition, 29 undergraduates from$\backslash$nthe University of Colorado served as subjects. They were fulfilling part$\backslash$nof a course requirement. For the restricted reading time condition, 44$\backslash$nstudents were each paid {\$}2.00 for their participation.\backslashnMaterial. Two sets of materials were constructed for this experiment.\backslashnSet A consisted of 10 sentences which were 16-17 words long counting\backslashnpunctuation, 1616 otherwise. The sentences were not related to each\backslashnother, most of them dealing with topics from classical history. This choice\backslashnof topics was made in an attempt to hold the relative familarity of the\backslashntext at a minimum, while avoiding problems of vocabulary concomitant\backslashnwith equally unfamiliar but more technical material.\backslashnAlthough word length in these sentences was fairly strictly controlled,\backslashnthe number of propositions upon which each sentence was based varied\backslashnbetween four and nine. Two sample sentences, together with the propositions\backslashnfrom which they were constructed and the hierarchical relationships\backslashnwhich exist among these propositions, are shown in Table 1. The analysis\backslashninto propositions was made according to the theory described in Kintsch\backslashnTABLE 1\backslashnVIII.

Briefly, each proposition consists of a relational term (written\backslashnfirst) and one or more arguments. Propositions may themselves appear\backslashnas arguments of other propositions, in which case Greek letters were used\backslashnin order to avoid overly complex expressions. The analysis used here\backslashndiffers from that proposed earlier (Kintsch, 1972) in only one minor\backslashnrespect: the restriction that verbs may not be used as arguments in\backslashnpropositions has been dropped; this led to some considerable simplifications\backslashnin the obtained expressions. Propositions have been numbered\backslashnsolely for the purpose of identification in the graphs showing the hierarchical\backslashnrelations among them. As described in Kintsch (1972), these\backslashnhierarchical relations are implicit in the order in which propositions are\backslashnwritten: a proposition /3 is subordinated to another proposition (Y if (Y precedes\backslashnp in the list of propositions and if (Y and ,8 have at least one term\backslashn(relation or argument) in common.\backslashnOne of the major problems in work of this type is that no algorithmic\backslashnprocedure exists to analyze a given sentence (or paragraph) into its\backslashnpropositional base structure. However, for present purposes the problem\backslashncan be circumvented in the following way: one can start with the\backslashnpropositional expressions themselves and translate these into English\backslashntext. The rules for doing so are simpler and are somewhat better\backslashnunderstood, although they do not really exist in explicit form either.\backslashnAt least very substantial agreement could be obtained that the\backslashnsentences used are indeed one way to express the meaning of the coordinated\backslashnpropositions.\backslashnSet B consisted of 20 sentences or paragraphs in which the number\backslashnof underlying propositions and the number of words were confounded.\backslashnThe shortest sentence contained seven words in two propositions; the\backslashnlongest paragraphs were based upon 22 propositions, requiring 58 words,\backslashnand 23 propositions, requiring 45 words, All sentences in Set B were\backslashndefinitions and descriptions of psychological terms, modified from the\backslashnglossaries of several psychological texts, and thus, dealt with relatively\backslashnunfamiliar topics.\backslashnProcedure--free reading.

	abstract = {Current methods of assessing dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) in older adults involve structured interviews that attempt to capture the complex nature of deficits suffered. One of the most significant areas affected by the disease is the capacity for functional communication as linguistic skills break down. These methods often do note capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. We address this issue by exploring novel automatic and objective methods for diagnosing patients through analysis of spontaneous speech. We detail several lexical approaches to the problem of detecting and rating DAT. The approaches explored rely on character n-gram-based techniques, shown recently to perform successfully in a different, but related task of automatic authorship attribution. We also explore the correlation of usage frequency of different parts of speech and DAT. We achieve a high 95{\%} accuracy of detecting dementia when compared with a control group, and we achieve 70{\%} accuracy in rating dementia in two classes, and 50{\%} accuracy in rating dementia into four classes. Our results show that purely computational solutions offer a viable alternative to standard approaches to diagnosing the level of impairment in patients. These results are significant step forward toward automatic and objective means to identifying early symptoms of DAT in older adults.},

	abstract = {The speech characteristics on a standardized picture description task of 26 subjects with presumed senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and 13 subjects with stroke-related dementia (SRD) were compared to 15 normal subjects over age 59 years. Compared to the normal subjects, the dementia subjects used fewer total words, fewer unique words, fewer prepositional phrases, fewer subordinate clauses, and more incomplete sentence fragments. Lexical deficits tended to be more severe than syntactic ones, confirming prior suggestions that lexicon is more vulnerable to disruption in dementia than syntax. Greater dementia severity among the SDAT subjects was associated with marked difficulties in accessing the mental lexicon (increased use of empty words, indefinite anaphora, and pronouns). Greater dementia severity in the SRD subjects was associated with laconic speech that was syntactially less complex. Diffuse brain injury (as typified by SDAT) appears to disproportionately affect lexicon whereas multifocal injury (as typified by SRD) has a disproportionate effect on syntax (assuming that focal lesions of the posterior language zone have been excluded). The speech characteristics of the mild SDAT subjects showed similarities to those of anomic or semantic aphasia whereas the speech of the more advanced SDAT subjects showed similarities to Wernicke aphasia or transcortical sensory aphasia. The speech of the subjects with more severe SRD showed some similarities to Broca aphasia. The most important nonlinguistic deficit in both the SRD and the SDAT groups was a failure to make relevant observations during the picture description task. Perseverations were present in the speech of both the SRD and SDAT subjects, whereas aposiopesis, logorrhea, and palilalia were more typical of the SDAT subjects. Laconic speech was more characteristic of the SRD subjects. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Language change can be a valuable biological marker of overall cognitive change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia. Previous reports have described increased use of language formulas in AD, i.e., combinations likely processed in a holistic manner. Words that commonly occur together are more likely to become a formula. OBJECTIVE: To determine if frequency of co-occurrence as one indicator for formulaic language can distinguish people with probable AD from controls and if variables are sensitive to time post-symptom onset. METHODS: We developed the Frequency in Language Analysis Tool (FLAT), which indicates degrees of formulaicity in an individual language sample. The FLAT accomplishes this by comparing individual language samples to co-occurrence data from the British National Corpus (BNC). Our analysis also contained more conventional language variables in order to assess novel contributions of the FLAT. We analyzed data from the Pitt Corpus, which is part of DementiaBank. RESULTS: Both conventional and co-occurrence variables were able to distinguish AD and control groups. According to co-occurrence data, people with probable AD produced more formulaic language than controls. Only co-occurrence variables correlated with disease progression. DISCUSSION: Frequency of word co-occurrences is one indicator for formulaicity and a valuable contribution to characterizing language change in AD.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the potential of three assessments of language function in the diagnosis of Alzheimer-type dementia (DAT). A total of 115 patients (mean age 65.9 years) attending a memory clinic were assessed using three language tests: a picture description task (Boston Cookie-Theft picture), the Boston Naming Test, and a semantic and phonemic word fluency measure. Results of these assessments were compared with those of clinical diagnosis including the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). The patients were classified by ICD-10 diagnosis and GDS stage as without cognitive impairment (n = 40), mild cognitive impairment (n = 34), mild DAT (n = 21), and moderate to severe DAT (n = 20). Hypotheses were (a) that the complex task of a picture description could more readily identify language disturbances than specific language tests and that (b) examination of spontaneous speech could help to identify patients with even mild forms of DAT. In the picture description task, all diagnostic groups produced an equal number of words. However, patients with mild or moderate to severe DAT described significantly fewer objects and persons, actions, features, and localizations than patients without or with mild cognitive impairment. Persons with mild cognitive impairment had results similar to those without cognitive impairment. The Boston Naming Test and both fluency measures were superior to the picture description task in differentiating the diagnostic groups. In sum, both hypotheses had to be rejected.

	abstract = {Patterns of discourse--as reflected in the use of propositions, cohesion devices, and in judgments of coherence--in the speech of 6 well elderly and 6 patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) during topic-centered interviews were compared. Compared to the well elderly, SDAT patients used significantly more words and conversational turns. The interviewer also used more words and turns when interviewing SDAT patients, making those interviews more lengthy and more interactive than those of the elderly comparison group. Although significant differences in propositional form and cohesion devices were not found, a pattern of cohesion disruptions in SDAT patients was identified that appears consistent with previously noted patterns of language dissolution. Coherence judgements by four listeners showed significant differences between the two groups. The breakdowns in coherence were related to one subtype of cohesion disruption, missing element. This suggests that incoherence may result in part from a loss of the ability to take the listener's perspective in developing thematic structure during conversation. It is argued that SDAT results not only in the impairment of linguistic abilities but also in the impairment of discourse abilities that contribute to Alzheimer patients' incoherent speech.},

	abstract = {Mixed vascular and Alzheimer-type dementia and pure Alzheimer's disease are both  associated with changes in spoken language. These changes have, however, seldom been subjected to systematic comparison. In the present study, we analyzed language samples obtained during the course of a longitudinal clinical study from patients in whom one or other pathology was verified at post mortem. The aims of the study were twofold: first, to confirm the presence of differences in language produced by members of the two groups using quantitative methods of evaluation; and secondly to ascertain the most informative sources of variation between the groups. We adopted a computational approach to evaluate digitized transcripts of connected speech along a range of language-related dimensions. We then used machine learning text classification to assign the samples to one of the two pathological groups on the basis of these features. The classifiers' accuracies were tested using simple lexical features, syntactic features, and more complex statistical and information theory characteristics. Maximum accuracy was achieved when word occurrences and frequencies alone were used. Features based on syntactic and lexical complexity yielded lower discrimination scores, but all combinations of features showed significantly better performance than a baseline condition in which every transcript was assigned randomly to one of the two classes. The classification results illustrate the word content specific differences in the spoken language of the two groups. In addition, those with mixed pathology were found to exhibit a marked reduction in lexical variation and complexity compared to their pure AD counterparts.},

	abstract = {Although an insidious history of episodic memory difficulty is a typical presenting symptom of Alzheimer's disease, detailed neuropsychological profiling frequently demonstrates deficits in other cognitive domains, including language. Previous studies from our group have shown that language changes may be reflected in connected speech production in the earliest stages of typical Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to identify features of connected speech that could be used to examine longitudinal profiles of impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Samples of connected speech were obtained from 15 former participants in a longitudinal cohort study of ageing and dementia, in whom Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed during life and confirmed at post-mortem. All patients met clinical and neuropsychological criteria for mild cognitive impairment between 6 and 18 months before converting to a status of probable Alzheimer's disease. In a subset of these patients neuropsychological data were available, both at the point of conversion to Alzheimer's disease, and after disease severity had progressed from the mild to moderate stage. Connected speech samples from these patients were examined at later disease stages. Spoken language samples were obtained using the Cookie Theft picture description task. Samples were analysed using measures of syntactic complexity, lexical content, speech production, fluency and semantic content. Individual case analysis revealed that subtle changes in language were evident during the prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease, with two-thirds of patients with mild cognitive impairment showing significant but heterogeneous changes in connected speech. However, impairments at the mild cognitive impairment stage did not necessarily entail deficits at mild or moderate stages of disease, suggesting non-language influences on some aspects of performance. Subsequent examination of these measures revealed significant linear trends over the three stages of disease in syntactic complexity, semantic and lexical content. The findings suggest, first, that there is a progressive disruption in language integrity, detectable from the prodromal stage in a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and secondly that measures of semantic and lexical content and syntactic complexity best capture the global progression of linguistic impairment through the successive clinical stages of disease. The identification of disease-specific language impairment in prodromal Alzheimer's disease could enhance clinicians' ability to distinguish probable Alzheimer's disease from changes attributable to ageing, while longitudinal assessment could provide a simple approach to disease monitoring in therapeutic trials.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Background: Language assessment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrates deficits in single-word production, but rarely includes connected speech. Aims: If Alzheimer's disease leads to deficits in lexical retrieval, we should find reduced word output in connected speech, limited lexical diversity, an increase in retrieval errors, and an association between scores on tests of single-word production and measures of word retrieval in context. The purpose of this review was to inves-tigate these hypotheses across studies of connected speech in AD. Main Contribution: A search of Medline and PsychNET identified 51 articles (published in 1985–2016) that reported data from 1,114 individuals with AD and 1,280 cognitively healthy individuals. A meta-analysis showed a significant but small reduction in word output in AD. No consistent decrease in the proportion of unique words was documented, but there was indication that individuals with AD produce more frequent words than do controls. An analysis of errors documented a moderate effect size, showing that indivi-duals with AD commit more retrieval errors of all types. A relatively strong association was found between picture-naming scores and measures of word retrieval in connected speech. Conclusions: The review shows that individuals with AD experi-ence significant lexical retrieval difficulties in connected speech. ARTICLE HISTORY},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various types of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are manifested as irregularities in human speech and language, which have proven to be strong predictors for the disease presence and progress ion. Therefore, automatic speech analytics provided by a mobile application may be a useful tool in providing additional indicators for assessment and detection of early stage dementia and MCI., METHOD: 165 participants (subjects with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), MCI patients, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mixed dementia (MD) patients) were recorded with a mobile application while performing several short vocal cognitive tasks during a regular consultation. These tasks included verbal fluency, picture description, counting down and a free speech task. The voice recordings were processed in two steps: in the first step, vocal markers were extracted using speech signal processing techniques; in the second, the vocal markers were tested to assess their 'power' to distinguish between SCI, MCI, AD and MD. The second step included training automatic classifiers for detecting MCI and AD, based on machine learning methods, and testing the detection accuracy., RESULTS: The fluency and free speech tasks obtain the highest accuracy rates of classifying AD vs. MD vs. MCI vs. SCI. Using the data, we demonstrated classification accuracy as follows: SCI vs. AD = 92{\%} accuracy; SCI vs. MD = 92{\%} accuracy; SCI vs. MCI = 86{\%} accuracy and MCI vs. AD = 86{\%}., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the potential value of vocal analytics and the use of a mobile application for accurate automatic differentiation between SCI, MCI and AD. This tool can provide the clinician with meaningful information for assessment and monitoring of people with MCI and AD based on a non-invasive, simple and low-cost method.Copyright{\textcopyright} Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.},

	abstract = {Background: The manual diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related Dementias has been a challenge. Currently, these disorders are diagnosed using specific clinical diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological examinations. The use of several Machine Learning algorithms to build automated diagnostic models using low-level linguistic features resulting from verbal utterances could aid diagnosis of patients with probable AD from a large population. For this purpose, we developed different Machine Learning models on the DementiaBank language transcript clinical dataset, consisting of 99 patients with probable AD and 99 healthy controls. Results: Our models learned several syntactic, lexical, and n-gram linguistic biomarkers to distinguish the probable AD group from the healthy group. In contrast to the healthy group, we found that the probable AD patients had significantly less usage of syntactic components and significantly higher usage of lexical components in their language. Also, we observed a significant difference in the use of n-grams as the healthy group were able to identify and make sense of more objects in their n-grams than the probable AD group. As such, our best diagnostic model significantly distinguished the probable AD group from the healthy elderly group with a better Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) using the Support Vector Machines (SVM). Conclusions: Experimental and statistical evaluations suggest that using ML algorithms for learning linguistic biomarkers from the verbal utterances of elderly individuals could help the clinical diagnosis of probable AD. We emphasise that the best ML model for predicting the disease group combines significant syntactic, lexical and top n-gram features. However, there is a need to train the diagnostic models on larger datasets, which could lead to a better AUC and clinical diagnosis of probable AD.},

One of the most significant areas affected by the disease is the capacity for functional communication as linguistic skills break down. These methods often do note capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. We address this issue by exploring novel automatic and objective methods for diagnosing patients through analysis of spontaneous speech. We detail several lexical approaches to the problem of detecting and rating DAT. The approaches explored rely on character n-gram-based techniques, shown recently to perform successfully in a different, but related task of automatic authorship attribution. We also explore the correlation of usage frequency of different parts of speech and DAT. We achieve a high 95{\%} accuracy of detecting dementia when compared with a control group, and we achieve 70{\%} accuracy in rating dementia in two classes, and 50{\%} accuracy in rating dementia into four classes. Our results show that purely computational solutions offer a viable alternative to standard approaches to diagnosing the level of impairment in patients. These results are significant step forward toward automatic and objective means to identifying early symptoms of DAT in older adults.},
