The workgroup developed the following two sets of criteria: (1) core clinical criteria that could be used by healthcare providers without access to advanced imaging techniques or cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and (2) research criteria that could be used in clinical research settings, including clinical trials. The second set of criteria incorporate the use of biomarkers based on imaging and cerebrospinal fluid measures. The final set of criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to AD has four levels of certainty, depending on the presence and nature of the biomarker findings. Considerable work is needed to validate the criteria that use biomarkers and to standardize biomarker analysis for the use in community settings.},

abstract = {Conversational storytelling integrates diverse cognitive and socio-emotional abilities that critically differ across neurodegenerative disease groups. Storytelling patterns may have diagnostic relevance and predict anatomic changes. The present study employed mixed methods discourse and quantitative analyses to delineate patterns of storytelling across focal neurodegenerative disease groups, and to clarify the neuroanatomical contributions to common storytelling characteristics. Transcripts of spontaneous social interactions of 46 participants (15 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 7 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 12 healthy older normal controls (NC)) were analyzed for storytelling frequency and characteristics, and videos of the interactions were rated for patients' level of social attentiveness. Compared to controls, svPPAs told more stories and autobiographical stories, and perseverated on aspects of self during the interaction, whereas ADs told fewer autobiographical stories than NCs. svPPAs and bvFTDs were rated as less attentive to social cues. Aspects of storytelling were related to diverse cognitive and socio-emotional functions, and voxel-based anatomic analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging revealed that temporal organization, narrative evaluations patterns, and social attentiveness correlated with atrophy corresponding to known intrinsic connectivity networks, including the default mode, limbic, salience, and stable task control networks. Differences in spontaneous storytelling among neurodegenerative groups elucidated diverse cognitive, socio-emotional, and neural contributions to narrative production, with implications for diagnostic screening and therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {We analyzed spontaneous speech production in semi-standardized interviews conducted with 10 patients suffering from moderate senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), 5 Wernicke's aphasics, and 5 elderly controls without brain damage. Data analysis revealed in both patient groups a reduction of sentence length but absence of systematic paragrammatic symptoms on the part of the demented patients. A relatively selectively diminished use of nouns was striking in the production of both patient groups, whereas word finding ability was surprisingly well preserved in the SDAT patients. Both patient groups exhibited marked deficits but different patterns of pathological behaviour on the discourse level of responding to the interviewer's questions. Results are interpreted within a proposed neurolinguistic language production model. It is argued that the formulation process may be preserved in demented patients but is disturbed in aphasia. Language-related disturbances in senile dementia are assumed to result from pre-linguistic disorders in the formation of the conceptual structure of the intended speech act. {\textcopyright} 1987 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

abstract = {Patients with degenerative dementia often show language disorders, but little is known about their verbal (VC) and non-verbal communication (NVC). Our aim was to analyse VC and NVC in patients with standard criteria of mild-moderately severe dementia (MMSE≥14/30) resulting from Alzheimer's disease (AD; 29 cases), behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD; 16), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; 13). We used the Lille Communication Test, which addresses three domains: participation in communication (PC: greeting, attention, participation), VC (verbal comprehension, speech outflow, intelligibility, word production, syntax, verbal pragmatics and verbal feedback), and NVC (understanding gestures, affective expressivity, producing gestures, pragmatics and feedback). Patients were compared with 47 matching control subjects. AD patients were partially impaired (p≤0.01) in PC (greeting), and more definitely in VC, especially by verbal comprehension and word finding difficulties and to a much lesser degree in verbal pragmatics (responding to open questions, presenting new information), while NVC was mostly preserved. FTD patients were severely impaired in PC. VC difficulties were related to lexical-semantic, syntactic and more specifically pragmatic problems. NVC was impaired by difficulties in affective expressivity, pragmatics and feedback management. DLB patients showed modest difficulties with VC. PC, VC and NVC strongly correlated with performance in the dementia rating scale. In conclusion, the profile of communication difficulties was quite different between groups. FTD patients showed most severe difficulties in PC and verbal and non-verbal pragmatics, in relation to their frontal lesions. AD patients had prominent impairment of lexical-semantic operations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper compares discourse performance across three groups, i.e., patients with mild to high-moderate aphasia (APH), mild to early-moderate stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), and normal control subjects (NC) across tasks that elicited discourse texts of varying linguistic and pragmatic difficulty using fables, single-frame pictures, and proverbs. We investigated discourse performance in terms of linguistic formulation and three pragmatic aspects including inferencing, interpreting communicative intentions, and ratio of language to information. The results revealed that the APH group received significantly lower scores than both the AD and NC groups on linguistic formulation. The patients with AD exhibited significant difficulties on the pragmatic domain of drawing inferences as compared to the APH and NC groups. For the majority of tasks, there were no significant group differences on the communicative intentions measure. However, there were significant differences on the domain of language-information balance for APH and AD groups on most tasks as compared to the NC group. The disparity in linguistic formulation and ability to draw inferences between AD and APH groups suggests that discourse differences at mild levels of impairment for these two neurological diseases are qualitatively different. Explanations for these difficulties as well as theoretical and clinical implications are delineated.},

Recently, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) increasingly substitute for the MMSE. However, there are no specific cutoffs in the ACE-III for mild dementia. The objectives of this exploratory study were to assess the sensitivity of each scale to everyday functioning and to examine the cutoffs between mild and moderate dementia on the ACE-III.MethodsPeople with mild dementia completed the MMSE, MoCA and ACE-III, whilst informal carers completed the Revised Interview for Deteriorations in Daily Living Activities for Dementia to rate their relative's initiative and performance of instrumental activities of daily living and the Katz activities of daily living scale. Data were analysed using correlation analysis, raw score comparisons, Cohen's kappa and receiver operating characteristics analysis.ResultsThirty-three dyads completed the measures. The ACE-III was the most sensitive tool for everyday functioning performance, whilst its language subscale was specifically related to initiation of activities. The most suitable cutoff on the ACE-III between mild and moderate dementia was 61.ConclusionsFindings suggest the ACE-III more efficiently identifies everyday functional impairments. Further research is required to confirm these exploratory analyses of the cutoff between mild and moderate dementia on the ACE-III. Both functional impairment and stage of dementia are needed in the diagnostic process and in the clinical assessment of people with dementia.},

abstract = {This study examines the impact of progressive degeneration of conceptual knowledge on the content words used in connected speech elicited using the Cookie Theft picture description (Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983). We began with an analysis of control subjects' descriptions with regard to word types and their frequency and imageability. Because the impairment of conceptual knowledge in semantic dementia is graded by concept familiarity, we created a model of a standardized normal Cookie Theft description that was then progressively degraded by the systematic removal of lower bands of word frequency. We drew two main predictions from this model: reduced availability of the lower bands of word frequency should result in (a) an apparent deficit for noun retrieval in relation to verb retrieval and (b) an apparent reverse imageability effect. Results from a longitudinal study, in which three patients with semantic dementia each described the Cookie Theft picture on three occasions during the progression of their disease, confirmed these predictions. An additional cross-sectional analysis, adding narratives from a larger number of cases, demonstrated that the decline in ability to produce suitable words for the picture description is closely related to the extent of semantic impairment as measured in tests of word comprehension and production. Both verbs and nouns are affected by the degradation of semantic memory; the fact that the impairment to noun production is manifested earlier and more catastrophically may be attributed to the relatively lower frequency of these terms.

Compared to the well elderly, SDAT patients used significantly more words and conversational turns. The interviewer also used more words and turns when interviewing SDAT patients, making those interviews more lengthy and more interactive than those of the elderly comparison group. Although significant differences in propositional form and cohesion devices were not found, a pattern of cohesion disruptions in SDAT patients was identified that appears consistent with previously noted patterns of language dissolution. Coherence judgments by four listeners showed significant differences between the two groups. The breakdowns in coherence were related to one subtype of cohesion disruption, missing element. This suggests that incoherence may result in part from a loss of the ability to take the listener's perspective in developing thematic structure during conversation. It is argued that SDAT results not only in the impairment of linguistic abilities but also in the impairment of discourse abilities that contribute to Alzheimer patients' incoherent speech.},

Recent cognitive decline screening batteries have highlighted the importance of language deficits related to semantic knowledge breakdown to reveal the incipient dementia. This paper proposes the introduction of novel enriched linguistic tests and examines the hypothesis that language can be a sensitive cognitive measure for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A group of MCI and healthy elderly were administered a set of proposed linguistic tests. Performance measures were made on both groups to indicate that concrete verbal production deficits such as impaired verb fluency can distinguish the MCI from normal aging. In addition, it was found that even in cases where the MCI subjects preserved scores, language tests took significantly more time compared to healthy controls. These findings indicate that language could be a sensitive cognitive marker in preclinical stages of MCI.},

Language impairment in Alzheimer's disease primarily occurs because of decline in semantic and pragmatic levels of language processing. Given the centrality of language to cognitive function, a number of language-specific scales have been developed to assess language deficits throughout progression of the disease and to evaluate the effects of pharmacotherapy on language function. Trials of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, used for the treatment of clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, have generally focused on overall cognitive effects. However, in the current report, we review data indicating specific beneficial effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on language abilities in patients with Alzheimer's disease, with a particular focus on outcomes among patients in the moderate and severe disease stages, during which communication is at risk and preservation is particularly important.},

We investigated the possible cognitive mechanism of the naming difficulty in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by analyzing the error patterns presented in the BNT. Methods: The Chinese version of the 30-item BNT (BNT-30) was performed on 115 normal control (NC) subjects and 104 mild-to-moderate AD patients. Accurate rates after semantic and phonemic cues were analyzed. The frequencies of 7 types of error patterns in the AD patients and the NC subjects were compared. Results: The accurate rate after semantic cues was significantly lower in the AD than in the NC groups, but phonemic cues were more helpful than semantic cues to achieve accurate naming in both groups. The AD patients made more errors in all error patterns. Particularly, the frequency of nonresponse errors (n = 806) in the AD group significantly exceeded that in the NC group (n = 382). However, the distribution of the error patterns did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion: Naming difficulties in AD might be attributed to progressive semantic knowledge degradation. The AD and the NC groups differ quantitatively but not qualitatively in the error patterns in confrontation naming. (c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract = {Despite the long-standing interest in structural aspects of aphasic production, no method has emerged for the systematic analysis of aphasic speech. This paper attempts to address that need by outlining a procedure for the quantitative assessment of narrative speech which yields measures for both morphological and structural characteristics of aphasic production. In addition to complete instructions for carrying out this analysis, data for three groups of subjects are presented: agrammatic aphasics, aphasics who are similarly nonfluent but not clinically judged as agrammatic, and normal controls. While the agrammatics were distinguishable from the nonagrammatic patients on most measures, both nonfluent groups showed comparable reductions in the structural complexity of their propositional utterances. Other findings include indications from individual patient data that aspects of grammatical morphology may dissociate in agrammatism. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {The pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to begin many years before the diagnosis of AD dementia. This long “preclinical” phase of AD would provide a critical opportunity for therapeutic intervention; however, we need to further elucidate the link between the pathological cascade of AD and the emergence of clinical symptoms. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened an international workgroup to review the biomarker, epidemiological, and neuropsychological evidence, and to develop recommendations to determine the factors which best predict the risk of progression from “normal” cognition to mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. We propose a conceptual framework and operational research criteria, based on the prevailing scientific evidence to date, to test and refine these models with longitudinal clinical research studies. These recommendations are solely intended for research purposes and do not have any clinical implications at this time. It is hoped that these recommendations will provide a common rubric to advance the study of preclinical AD, and ultimately, aid the field in moving toward earlier intervention at a stage of AD when some disease- modifying therapies may be most efficacious.},

METHODS: Age- and education-matched groups of participants with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and subjective memory complaints and healthy controls were assessed with 16 cognitive tests encompassing attention, orientation, episodic and semantic memory, and language tasks. RESULTS: The battery correctly distinguished AD patients from healthy seniors in 92{\%} of the cases. Three semantic memory-based tasks turned out to be particularly powerful for this purpose. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that semantic memory tasks should be included in the battery of tests for the evaluation of cognitively impaired patients.},

abstract = {The pervasive use of clinical categories of aphasia in neurolinguistic and cognitive neuropsychological research reflects the assumption that these patient groupings represent disruptions of the normal language processing system along theoretically significant lines. This premise is examined here with particular reference to the status of 'agrammatism'. It is argued that there are compelling reasons to question the coherence of agrammatism as a psychological entity. To overcome these objections, the clinical intuitions on which this aphasic category is based must be replaced by objective criteria for selecting a theoretically significant patient grouping. To reach this goal, it is especially important that a theoretically motivated distinction be made between within-and across-category variation. It is argued that in the case of categories like agrammatism, there are serious methodological obstacles which make such goals unreachable. It is argued, therefore, that our theories should not take categories like agrammatism as psychological givens, especially if the purpose of our research is to reach an understanding of the mechanisms of language processing or of individual aphasic deficits themselves. Furthermore, it is argued that the single case methodology for the study of aphasia can address these goals by taking patterns of performance on particular linguistic tasks as basic units of analysis, and that this approach avoids the methodological pitfalls faced by studies which take clinical categories as starting points. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {Primary progressive aphasia is a clinical syndrome defined by progressive deficits isolated to speech and/or language, and can be classified into non-fluent, semantic and logopenic variants based on motor speech, linguistic and cognitive features. The connected speech of patients with primary progressive aphasia has often been dichotomized simply as 'fluent' or 'non-fluent', however fluency is a multidimensional construct that encompasses features such as speech rate, phrase length, articulatory agility and syntactic structure, which are not always impacted in parallel. In this study, our first objective was to improve the characterization of connected speech production in each variant of primary progressive aphasia, by quantifying speech output along a number of motor speech and linguistic dimensions simultaneously. Secondly, we aimed to determine the neuroanatomical correlates of changes along these different dimensions. We recorded, transcribed and analysed speech samples for 50 patients with primary progressive aphasia, along with neurodegenerative and normal control groups. Patients were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging, and voxel-based morphometry was used to identify regions where atrophy correlated significantly with motor speech and linguistic features. Speech samples in patients with the non-fluent variant were characterized by slow rate, distortions, syntactic errors and reduced complexity. In contrast, patients with the semantic variant exhibited normal rate and very few speech or syntactic errors, but showed increased proportions of closed class words, pronouns and verbs, and higher frequency nouns, reflecting lexical retrieval deficits. In patients with the logopenic variant, speech rate (a common proxy for fluency) was intermediate between the other two variants, but distortions and syntactic errors were less common than in the non-fluent variant, while lexical access was less impaired than in the semantic variant. Reduced speech rate was linked with atrophy to a wide range of both anterior and posterior language regions, but specific deficits had more circumscribed anatomical correlates. Frontal regions were associated with motor speech and syntactic processes, anterior and inferior temporal regions with lexical retrieval, and posterior temporal regions with phonological errors and several other types of disruptions to fluency. These findings demonstrate that a multidimensional quantification of connected speech production is necessary to characterize the differences between the speech patterns of each primary progressive aphasic variant adequately, and to reveal associations between particular aspects of connected speech and specific components of the neural network for speech production.},

abstract = {Techniques for measuring cerebral perfusion require accurate longitudinal relaxation (T1) of blood, a MRI parameter that is field dependent. T1 of arterial and venous human blood was measured at 7T using three different sources – pathology laboratory, blood bank and in vivo. The T1 of venous blood was measured from sealed samples from a pathology lab and in vivo. Samples from a blood bank were oxygenated and mixed to obtain different physiological concentrations of hematocrit and oxygenation. T1 relaxation times were estimated using a three-point fit to a simple inversion recovery equation. At 37° C, the T1 of blood at arterial pO2was 2.29 ± 0.1 s and 2.07 ± 0.12 at venous pO2. The in vivo T1 of venous blood, in three subjects, was slightly longer at 2.45 ± 0.11s. T1 of arterial and venous blood at 7T was measured and found to be significantly different. The T1 values were longer in vivo than in vitro. While the exact cause for the discrepancy is unknown, the additives in the blood samples, degradation during experiment, oxygenation differences, and the non-stagnant nature of blood in vivo could be potential contributors to the lower values of T1 in the venous samples.

abstract = {The informativeness of written language, as measured by Propositional Idea Density (PD), has been shown to be a sensitive predictive index of language decline with age and dementia in previous research. The present study investigated the influence of age and education on the written language of three large cohorts of women from the general community, born between 1973 and 1978, 1946-51 and 1921-26. Written texts were obtained from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health in which participants were invited to respond to an open-ended question about their health. The informativeness of written comments of 10 words or more (90{\%} of the total number of comments) was analyzed using the Computerized Propositional Idea Density Rater 3 (CPIDR-3). Over 2.5 million words used in 37,705 written responses from 19,512 respondents were analyzed. Based on a linear mixed model approach to statistical analysis with adjustment for several factors including number of comments per respondent and number of words per comment, a small but statistically significant effect of age was identified for the older cohort with mean age 78 years. The mean PD per word for this cohort was lower than the younger and mid-aged cohorts with mean age 27 and 53 years respectively, with mean reduction in PD 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) of .006 (003, .008) and .009 (008, .011) respectively. This suggests that PD for this population of women was relatively more stable over the adult lifespan than has been reported previously even in late old age. There was no statistically significant effect of education level. Computerized analyses were found to greatly facilitate the study of informativeness of this large corpus of written language. Directions for further research are discussed in relation to the need for extended investigation of the variability of the measure for potential application to the identification of acquired language pathologies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mixed vascular and Alzheimer-type dementia and pure Alzheimer's disease are both  associated with changes in spoken language. These changes have, however, seldom been subjected to systematic comparison. In the present study, we analyzed language samples obtained during the course of a longitudinal clinical study from patients in whom one or other pathology was verified at post mortem. The aims of the study were twofold: first, to confirm the presence of differences in language produced by members of the two groups using quantitative methods of evaluation; and secondly to ascertain the most informative sources of variation between the groups. We adopted a computational approach to evaluate digitized transcripts of connected speech along a range of language-related dimensions. We then used machine learning text classification to assign the samples to one of the two pathological groups on the basis of these features. The classifiers' accuracies were tested using simple lexical features, syntactic features, and more complex statistical and information theory characteristics. Maximum accuracy was achieved when word occurrences and frequencies alone were used. Features based on syntactic and lexical complexity yielded lower discrimination scores, but all combinations of features showed significantly better performance than a baseline condition in which every transcript was assigned randomly to one of the two classes. The classification results illustrate the word content specific differences in the spoken language of the two groups. In addition, those with mixed pathology were found to exhibit a marked reduction in lexical variation and complexity compared to their pure AD counterparts.},

abstract = {In the early stages of neurodegenerative disorders, individuals may exhibit a decline in language abilities that is difficult to quantify with standardized tests. Careful analysis of connected speech can provide valuable information about a patient's language capacities. To date, this type of analysis has been limited by its time-consuming nature. In this study, we present a method for evaluating and classifying connected speech in primary progressive aphasia using computational techniques. Syntactic and semantic features were automatically extracted from transcriptions of narrative speech for three groups: semantic dementia (SD), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and healthy controls. Features that varied significantly between the groups were used to train machine learning classifiers, which were then tested on held-out data. We achieved accuracies well above baseline on the three binary classification tasks. An analysis of the influential features showed that in contrast with controls, both patient groups tended to use words which were higher in frequency (especially nouns for SD, and verbs for PNFA). The SD patients also tended to use words (especially nouns) that were higher in familiarity, and they produced fewer nouns, but more demonstratives and adverbs, than controls. The speech of the PNFA group tended to be slower and incorporate shorter words than controls. The patient groups were distinguished from each other by the SD patients' relatively increased use of words which are high in frequency and/or familiarity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, difficulties with compliance and economic costs marginalize many countries worldwide that do not have access to this new type of diagnosis. The opportunity exists to refine the conventional clinical method, without using biomarkers, to attempt an earlier diagnosis as there is information that supports the potential utility of a focused clinical interview, observation of gait and use of more demanding memory tests. {\textcopyright} 2012 IMSS.},

The purpose of our project is to contribute to earlier diagnosis of AD and allow better estimates of its severity by using automatic analysis performed through new biomarkers extracted through non-invasive intelligent methods. The method selected is based on speech biomarkers derived from the analysis of spontaneous speech (SS). Thus the main goal of the present work is feature search in SS, aiming at pre-clinical evaluation whose results can be used to select appropriate tests for AD diagnosis. The feature set employed in our earlier work offered some hopeful conclusions but failed to capture the nonlinear dynamics of speech that are present in the speech waveforms. The extra information provided by the nonlinear features could be especially useful when training data is limited. In this work, the fractal dimension (FD) of the observed time series is combined with linear parameters in the feature vector in order to enhance the performance of the original system while controlling the computational cost.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTBackground: Humans adapt to constantly changing internal and external conditions to meet survival needs. Persons with aphasia (PWA) are faced with changes in their physiological, cognitive, and affective state. They usually have physiological impairments in the frontal or temporal areas, which can lead to cognitive problems such as limited working memory, inefficient executive function, and lapse of attention. These problems have negative impacts on their language. Most PWA also experience long-term social anxiety, pressure, and other negative feelings caused by their illness. According to adaptation theory, symptoms such as omission and disfluency are not caused by deficits in language knowledge but by adaptive behaviours that PWA produce because of certain communicative purposes or the severity of aphasia.Aims: The purpose of this paper is to review the theories and facts concerning the adaptive language behaviours of PWA and to attempt to account for the features, motivations, and principles of...},

abstract = {English texts were constructed from propositional bases. One set of 16-word sentences was obtained from semantic bases containing from 4 to 9 propositions. For another set of sentences and paragraphs, number of words and number of propositions covaried. Subjects read the texts at their own rate and recalled them immediately. For the 16-word sentences, subjects needed 1.5 sec additional reading time to process each proposition. For longer texts, this value increased. In another experimental condition reading time was controlled by the experimenter. The analysis of both the text and the recall protocols in terms of number of propositions lent support to the notion that propositions are a basic unit of memory for text. However, evidence was also obtained that while the total number of propositions upon which a text was based proved to be an effective psychological variable, all propositions were not equally difficult to remember: superordinate propositions were recalled better than propositions which were stucturally subordinate. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

So far, little is known about the development of symptoms and their order of occurrence in the preclinical phase, and information regarding written text production is scarce.We had the unique opportunity to analyze the diary of a man written over a time span of 12 years before he was diagnosed with svPPA. We sought to identify the earliest indicators of cognitive change in his diary entries, and to track the important changes over time.Based on transcripts of the entries (one week every six months) we assessed the overall structure, vocabulary, surface dysgraphia and semantic paraphasia, syntax, and morphology. We found changes in all domains up to seven years before the clinical diagnosis. The earliest changes concerned the vocabulary, with decreased variety and increased use of high frequency words. This was followed by syntactic and morphological errors. We found no increase of surface dysgraphia. Semantic paraphasias increased only during the last three years but characterized the entries of the last year.We were therefore able to further corroborate recent findings regarding difficulties in the morpho-syntactic domain in this patient group. In this natural context for written text production, such errors seem, in addition to changes in vocabulary, to be the first error types to appear, possibly as a result of compensating for the degradation of semantic representations.},

abstract = {Advances in automatic text classification have been necessitated by the rapid increase in the availability of digital documents. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can 'learn' from data: for instance a ML system can be trained on a set of features derived from written texts belonging to known categories, and learn to distinguish between them. Such a trained system can then be used to classify unseen texts. In this paper, we explore the potential of the technique to classify transcribed speech samples along clinical dimensions, using vocabulary data alone. We report the accuracy with which two related ML algorithms [naive Bayes Gaussian (NBG) and naive Bayes multinomial (NBM)] categorized picture descriptions produced by: 32 semantic dementia (SD) patients versus 10 healthy, age-matched controls; and SD patients with left- ( n=21) versus right-predominant ( n=11) patterns of temporal lobe atrophy. We used information gain (IG) to identify the vocabulary features that were most informative to each of these two distinctions.In the SD versus control classification task, both algorithms achieved accuracies of greater than 90{\%}. In the right- versus left-temporal lobe predominant classification, NBM achieved a high level of accuracy (88{\%}), but this was achieved by both NBM and NBG when the features used in the training set were restricted to those with high values of IG. The most informative features for the patient versus control task were low frequency content words, generic terms and components of metanarrative statements. For the right versus left task the number of informative lexical features was too small to support any specific inferences. An enriched feature set, including values derived from Quantitative Production Analysis (QPA) may shed further light on this little understood distinction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical syndrome of dementia consists of several subtypes that are distinct in their etiology, clinical profile, management, and outcome. Limited specialized services are available for dementia patients in India. We report the profile of dementia subtypes from a clinic-based dementia registry in India. METHODS: Consecutive dementia patients were investigated with clinical evaluation, neuropsychological tests modified for local use, and brain imaging. RESULTS: In 347 consecutive dementia patients, Alzheimer's disease was the most common subtype of dementia (38.3{\%}), followed by a high proportion of vascular dementia (25.4{\%}). Frontotemporal dementia syndromes were not uncommon (18.7{\%}). Dementia with Lewy bodies was encountered in 8.9{\%} of the patients, and mixed dementia was found in 8.6{\%}. The mean age of the group at presentation was 66.3 years, nearly a decade younger than in developed countries. The proportion of patients with early-onset dementia was high (49.9{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the clinical profiles of dementia subtypes in a clinic population are influenced by the population's demographic profile, cardiovascular risk factor burden, sociocultural attitudes about cognitive impairment, and possibly genetic factors.},

abstract = {Introduction: The objective of this study was to assess the utility of novel verbal fluency scores for predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Method: Verbal fluency lists (animals, vegetables, F, A, and S) from 107 MCI patients and 51 cognitively normal controls were transcribed into electronic text files and automatically scored with traditional raw scores and five types of novel scores computed using methods from machine learning and natural language processing. Additional scores were derived from structural MRI scans: region of interest measures of hippocampal and ventricular volumes and gray matter scores derived from performing ICA on measures of cortical thickness. Over 4 years of follow-up, 24 MCI patients converted to AD. Using conversion as the outcome variable, ensemble classifiers were constructed by training classifiers on the individual groups of scores and then entering predictions from the primary classifiers into regularized logistic regression models. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was measured for classifiers trained with five groups of available variables. Results: Classifiers trained with novel scores outperformed those trained with raw scores (AUC 0.872 vs 0.735; P {\textless} .05 by DeLong test). Addition of structural brain measurements did not improve performance based on novel scores alone. Conclusion: The brevity and cost profile of verbal fluency tasks recommends their use for clinical decision making. The word lists generated are a rich source of information for predicting outcomes in MCI. Further work is needed to assess the utility of verbal fluency for early AD.},

abstract = {Little is known about the relationship between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and changes to language abilities. Here, we used the revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) to identify suspected MCI in elderly individuals. We then analyzed written and spoken narratives to compare the language abilities between study participants with and without MCI in order to explore the relationship between cognitive and language abilities, and to identify a possible indicator for the early detection of MCI and dementia. We recruited 22 people aged 74 to 86 years (mean: 78.32 years; standard deviation: 3.36). The participants were requested to write and talk about one of the happiest events in their lives. Based on HDS-R scores, we divided the participants into 2 groups: the MCI Group comprised 8 participants with a score of 26 or lower, while the Healthy Group comprised 14 participants with a score of 27 or higher. The transcriptions of both written and spoken samples for each participant were used in the measurement of NLP-based language ability scores. Our analysis showed no significant differences in writing abilities between the 2 groups in any of the language ability scores. However, analysis of the spoken narrative showed that the MCI Group had a significantly larger vocabulary size. In addition, analysis of a metric that signified the gap in content between the spoken and written narratives also revealed a larger vocabulary size in the MCI Group. Individuals with early-stage MCI may be engaging in behavior to conceal their deteriorating cognition, thereby leading to a temporary increase in their active spoken vocabulary. These results indicate the possible detection of early stages of reduced cognition before dementia onset through the analysis of spoken narratives.},

Although this integration has produced a considerable body of results, the continued general gulf between these two lines of research is likely impeding progress in both: on learning in generative linguistics, and on the representation of language in neural modeling. The paper concludes with a brief argument that generative linguistics is unlikely to fulfill its promise of accounting for language learning if it continues to maintain its distance from neural and other statistical approaches to learning.},

abstract = {Dementia is a gradual cognitive decline that typically occurs as a consequence of neurode- generative disease, and can result in language deficits (i.e. aphasia). I show that linguistic features automatically extracted from the connected speech samples of individuals with de- mentia can both differentiate these individuals from healthy controls and contribute to our knowledge of the nature of language impairment in dementia. As a secondary goal, I address the challenges of a fully automated processing pipeline. I focus on a dementia syndrome known as primary progressive aphasia (PPA), in which language abilities are specifically impaired. I begin by automatically extracting linguistic in- formation from transcripts of PPA speech, training machine learning classifiers to differentiate between the different variants of PPA relative to healthy controls, and interpreting the selected features in the context of the PPA literature. While traditional measures of syntactic com- plexity do not distinguish between the groups, the inclusion of parse-based syntactic features ultimately leads to accuracies of over 90{\%} in three classification tasks. Having shown that the extracted features can differentiate the groups, I examine how these features degrade as a result of the processing steps in a fully automated pipeline, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and sentence segmentation. The classifiers still achieve positive results, although the degraded feature accuracy may be of concern in biomedical ap- plications. I then explore a question of some debate in the literature: Is there a difference between agrammatism in PPA and agrammatism in post-stroke aphasia? Above-baseline classification results suggest that there are indeed differences between these two impairments. Having validated the methodology on PPA, I conclude by examining whether a similar analysis will detect Alzheimer's disease from speech samples, even though language impair- ment is not the primary symptom of the disease. By including additional features to measure the information content of the narrative, classification accuracies of up to 81{\%} are achieved. I repeat the classification experiment using ASR transcripts, and find that many of the relevant features are still significantly different between the groups, suggesting that a fully automated analysis may be possible as ASR improves. iii},

abstract = {Detection of cognitive impairment, especially at the early stages, is critical. Such detection has traditionally been performed manually by one or more clinicians based on reports and test results. Machine learning algorithms offer an alternative method of detection that may provide an automated process and valuable insights into diagnosis and classification. In this paper, we explore the use of neuropsychological and demographic data to predict Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores (no dementia, very mild dementia, dementia) and clinical diagnoses (cognitively healthy, mild cognitive impairment, dementia) through the implementation of four machine learning algorithms, na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB), C4.5 decision tree (DT), back-propagation neural network (NN), and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, a feature selection method for reducing the number of neuropsychological and demographic data needed to make an accurate diagnosis was investigated. The NB classifier provided the best accuracies, while the SVM classifier proved to offer some of the lowest accuracies. We also illustrate that with the use of feature selection, accuracies can be improved. The experiments reported in this paper indicate that artificial intelligence techniques can be used to automate aspects of clinical diagnosis of individuals with cognitive impairment.

abstract = {The relationships between early life variables, cognitive function, and neuropathology were examined in participants in the Nun Study who were between the ages of 75 and 95. Our early life variable was idea density, which is a measure of linguistic ability, derived from autobiographies written at a mean age of 22 years. Six discrete categories of cognitive function, including mild cognitive impairments, were evaluated, using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) battery of cognitive tests. Neuropathologic data included Braak staging, neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque counts, brain weight, degree of cerebral atrophy, severity of atherosclerosis, and the presence of brain infarcts. Early-life idea density was significantly related to the categories of late-life cognitive function, including mild cognitive impairments: low idea density was associated with greater impairment. Low idea density also was significantly associated with lower brain weight, higher degree of cerebral atrophy, more severe neurofibrillary pathology, and the likelihood of meeting neuropathologic criteria for Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In recent years, a considerable number of studies have tried to establish which characteristics of objects and their names predict the responses of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the picture-naming task. The frequency of use of words and their age of acquisition (AoA) have been implicated as two of the most influential variables, with naming being best preserved for objects with high-frequency, early-acquired names. The present study takes a fresh look at the predictors of naming success in Spanish and English AD patients using a range of measures of word frequency and AoA along with visual complexity, imageability, and word length as predictors. Analyses using generalized linear mixed modelling found that naming accuracy was better predicted by AoA ratings taken from older adults than conventional ratings from young adults. Older frequency measures based on written language samples predicted accuracy better than more modern measures based on the frequencies of words in film subtitles. Replacing adult frequency with an estimate of cumulative (lifespan) frequency did not reduce the impact of AoA. Semantic error rates were predicted by both written word frequency and senior AoA while null response errors were only predicted by frequency. Visual complexity, imageability, and word length did not predict naming accuracy or errors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of productive language in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have focused on formal testing of syntax and semantics but have directed less attention to naturalistic discourse and formulaic language. Clinical observations suggest that individuals with AD retain the ability to produce formulaic language long after other cognitive abilities have deteriorated. AIMS: This study quantifies production of formulaic expressions in the spontaneous speech of individuals with AD. Persons with early- and late-onset forms of the disease were compared. METHODS {\&} PROCEDURES: Conversational language samples of individuals with early- (n = 5) and late-onset (n = 6) AD and healthy controls (n = 5) were analyzed to determine whether formulaic language, as measured by the number of words in formulaic expressions, differs between groups. OUTCOMES {\&} RESULTS: Results indicate that individuals with AD, regardless of age of onset, used significantly more formulaic expressions than healthy controls. The early- and late-onset AD groups did not differ on formulaic language measures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to a dual process model of cerebral function, which proposes differing processing principles for formulaic and novel expressions. In this model, subcortical areas, which remain intact into late in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, play an important role in the production of formulaic language. Applications to clinical practice include identifying preserved formulaic language and providing informed counseling to patient and family.},

Analysis of spontaneous speech revealed a normal range and frequency of syntactic constructions but poor lexical use. A writing task showed a similar divergence, with the ability to use syntactic cues significantly more intact than the ability to use semantic cues. The results are taken to indicate that syntactic ability is selectively preserved in AD. These findings are consistent with a modular theory of grammar and of mental functions more generally. A tentative explanation of these phenomena is proposed in which the overlearned and automatic nature of syntactic ability helps account for its resilience to cognitive dissolution and cortical degeneration.},

We examined the degree to which online sentence processing and offline sentence memory differed among older adults who showed risk for amnestic and nonamnestic varieties of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), based on psychometric classification.Method. Participants (N = 439) read a series of sentences in a self-paced word-by-word reading paradigm for subsequent recall and completed a standardized cognitive test battery. Participants were classified into 3 groups: unimpaired controls (N = 281), amnestic MCI (N = 94), or nonamnestic MCI (N = 64).Results. Relative to controls, both MCI groups had poorer sentence memory and showed reduced sentence wrap-up effects, indicating reduced allocation to semantic integration processes. Wrap-up effects predicted subsequent recall in the control and nonamnestic groups. The amnestic MCI group showed poorer recall than the nonamnestic MCI group, and only the amnestic MCI group showed no relationship between sentence wrap-up and recall.Discussion. Our findings suggest that psychometrically defined sub-types of MCI are associated with unique deficits in sentence processing and can differentiate between the engagement of attentional resources during reading and the effectiveness of engaging attentional resources in producing improved memory. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND Non-verbal auditory impairment is increasingly recognised in the primary progressive aphasias (PPAs) but its relationship to speech processing and brain substrates has not been defined. Here we addressed these issues in patients representing the non-fluent variant (nfvPPA) and semantic variant (svPPA) syndromes of PPA. METHODS We studied 19 patients with PPA in relation to 19 healthy older individuals. We manipulated three key auditory parameters-temporal regularity, phonemic spectral structure and prosodic predictability (an index of fundamental information content, or entropy)-in sequences of spoken syllables. The ability of participants to process these parameters was assessed using two-alternative, forced-choice tasks and neuroanatomical associations of task performance were assessed using voxel-based morphometry of patients' brain magnetic resonance images. RESULTS Relative to healthy controls, both the nfvPPA and svPPA groups had impaired processing of phonemic spectral structure and signal predictability while the nfvPPA group additionally had impaired processing of temporal regularity in speech signals. Task performance correlated with standard disease severity and neurolinguistic measures. Across the patient cohort, performance on the temporal regularity task was associated with grey matter in the left supplementary motor area and right caudate, performance on the phoneme processing task was associated with grey matter in the left supramarginal gyrus, and performance on the prosodic predictability task was associated with grey matter in the right putamen. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that PPA syndromes may be underpinned by more generic deficits of auditory signal analysis, with a distributed cortico-subcortical neuraoanatomical substrate extending beyond the canonical language network. This has implications for syndrome classification and biomarker development.},

This study served to find out whether awareness of subjective memory com-plies with objective performance, if differences in awareness are observed longitudinally and whether decrease of awareness can serve as a predictor of AD in MCI patients. Methods Thirty-four patients with MCI seeking help in a memory outpatient clinic were included. All par-ticipants underwent thorough neuropsychological ex-amination. Awareness of subjective memory was ob-tained by calculating difference scores between pa-tient and informant ratings on a 16-item question-naire concerning complaints about loss of memory in every-day life. Retesting was performed after a mean follow-up period of 24 months. Results Whole group analyses showed that awareness remained relatively stable across time. Self-reported memory complaints correlated with episodic memory at baseline and with performance on a language task at follow-up. Retests displayed decrease of awareness. At group level differences in awareness between both times of assessment were not significant for MCI and MCI patients converting to mild AD at follow-up. The predictive value of awareness was low. Conclusions Awareness of subjective memory deficit is linked to episodic memory function and decreases with decline of cognitive ability. Further studies eval-uating predictive power of awareness of subjective memory should include a larger patient sample.

The objective of this study was to determine whether individuals with psychometric (preclinical) evidence of amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (pMCI) showed deficits in connected language measures. Participants were 39 pMCI and 39 cognitively healthy (CH) adults drawn from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, who were matched for age, literacy, and sex. Participants completed a connected language task in which they described the Cookie Theft picture from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. Language samples were analyzed across 3 language domains: content, syntactic complexity, and speech fluency. Paired t-tests were used to compare CH and pMCI groups on all variables, and Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated for each comparison. The CH and pMCI groups differed significantly on measures of content (e.g., CH group produced more semantic units, more unique words and had larger idea density, on average, than the pMCI group). The picture description findings are consistent with previous retrospective studies showing semantic language differences in adults with autopsy-confirmed AD. Given that these comparisons are between cognitively healthy and pMCI individuals (before a clinical MCI diagnosis), these findings may represent subtle language difficulty in spontaneous speech, and may be predictive of larger language changes over time.},

The neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying this symptom, termed anosognosia or impaired self-awareness, are still poorly understood. In the present study we aimed to explore the functional correlates of self-awareness in patients with MCI and AD. Methods: Fifty-one participants (17 healthy elderly, 17 patients with MCI, and 17 patients with AD), each accompanied by a study partner, took part in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, in which they were presented with questions regarding themselves (Self condition) or their study partner (Other condition). The study partner was asked to complete a paper questionnaire answering the same questions so the responses of participant and study partner could be compared and "discrepancy" scores calculated for each of the 2 conditions (Self and Other). Results: Behavioural results showed that AD patients had significantly higher "Self discrepancy scores" than controls and MCI patients, whereas there were no significant differences between groups for "Other discrepancy scores" Imaging results showed a significant group-by-condition interaction in brain activation in medial prefrontal and anterior temporal regions, with AD patients showing significantly decreased activation in these regions only for the Self condition. There were no significant differences between Self and Other conditions in either control or MCI groups, suggesting that, in these groups, Self- and Other-appraisal share similar neuroanatomical substrates. Conclusions: Decreased functional activation of medial prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices is associated with impaired self-awareness in AD patients. This dysfunction, which is specific for Self- but not for Other-appraisal, may be a contributing factor to anosognosia in AD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Anosognosia is present in a large proportion of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its frequency increases with the progression of the illness. Several instruments have been validated to assess anosognosia in AD, but there is no consensus regarding the best diagnostic strategy. Anosognosia in AD is a significant predictor of apathy and is significantly related to lower depression and anxiety scores, more severe caregiver burden and dangerous behaviours. Studies using different imaging modalities have demonstrated an association between anosognosia and dysfunction in frontal, temporomedial and temporoparietal regions. The mechanism of anosognosia remains unknown, but it has been explained as a consequence of deficits of encoding and updating biographical memory, and dysfunction of comparator, executive and metacognitive systems.},

abstract = {Here we quantitatively summarized evidence of impaired awareness in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and meta-analytically explored the relationship between Subjective Cognitive Complaints (SCC) and actual cognitive impairment. Twenty-three studies were included, 14 comparing awareness measures in MCI and healthy elderly subjects, and 16 also exploring the neuropsychological underpinnings of impaired awareness. Moderator analyses were conducted to determine whether self-awareness varied according to patient group, the particular state in relation to which insight was assessed, or the approach to measuring awareness. The meta-analysis shows that MCI patients have knowledge of their neuropsychological deficits and that level of awareness varies according to cognitive status, language and memory abilities. The assessment technique employed impacted on the insight phenomena. Specifically, MCI patients seem particularly accurate in evaluating the current state of their performance during an ongoing task and this could be essential in regulating their behavior so that compensative strategies are practiced and greater cognitive independence is achieved. Thus, assessment technique and cognitive status are crucial factors that influence level of awareness and should be taken into consideration in awareness evaluation and rehabilitation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDMild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia. However, much heterogeneity concerning neuropsychological measures, prevalence and progression rates impedes distinct diagnosis and treatment implications.OBJECTIVEAim of the present study was the identification of specific tests providing a high certainty for stable MCI and factors that precipitate instability of MCI in a community based sample examined at three measurement points.METHOD130 participants were tested annually with an extensive test battery including measures of memory, language, executive functions, intelligence and dementia screening tests. Exclusion criteria at baseline comprised, severe cognitive deficits (e.g. diagnosis of dementia, psychiatric or neurological disease). Possible predictors for stability or instability of MCI-diagnosis were analyzed using Regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Age, IQ and APOE status were tested for moderating effects on the interaction of test performances and group membership.RESULTSA high prevalence of MCI (49{\%}) was observed at baseline with a reversion rate of 18{\%} after two years. Stability of MCI was related to performances in four measures (VLMT: delayed recall, CERAD: recall drawings, CERAD: Boston Naming Test, Benton Visual Retention Test: number of mistakes). Conversion to MCI is associated with language functions. Reversion to 'normal' was primarily predicted by single domain impairment. There was no significant influence of demographic, medical or genetic variables.CONCLUSIONThe results highlight the role of repeated measurements for a reliable identification of functional neuropsychological predictors and better diagnostic reliability. In cases of high uncertainty close monitoring over time is needed in order of estimating outcome.},

In a recent cross-sectional study, we showed that Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) had similar effects on lexico-semantic processes in the two languages of highly proficient bilinguals (Costa et al., Neuropsychologia, 2012, 50, 740–53). In the present longitudinal study, we extend this finding by looking at the pattern of language deterioration over time in the same population of Catalan-Spanish bilingual patients. All the participants completed three language-processing tasks (picture naming, word translation and word comprehension), both in their dominant (L1) and non-dominant (L2) language. At one year, the final group was made up of 50 patients: 15 with MCI and 35 with AD. For AD but not MCI, the language deterioration over time was the same in both languages, as previously reported in the cross-sectional study. The results are discussed in the frame of the hypothesis of shared lexico-semantic processing in highly proficient bilinguals and the influence of executive control deficits in language production.},

abstract = {Current diagnostic criteria classify primary progressive aphasia into three variants–semantic (sv), nonfluent (nfv) and logopenic (lv) PPA–though the adequacy of this scheme is debated. This study took a data-driven approach, applying k-means clustering to data from 43 PPA patients. The algorithm grouped patients based on similarities in language, semantic and non-linguistic cognitive scores. The optimum solution consisted of three groups. One group, almost exclusively those diagnosed as svPPA, displayed a selective semantic impairment. A second cluster, with impairments to speech production, repetition and syntactic processing, contained a majority of patients with nfvPPA but also some lvPPA patients. The final group exhibited more severe deficits to speech, repetition and syntax as well as semantic and other cognitive deficits. These results suggest that, amongst cases of non-semantic PPA, differentiation mainly reflects overall degree of language/cognitive impairment. The observed patterns were scarcely affected by inclusion/exclusion of non-linguistic cognitive scores.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Neuropsychological testing is considered crucial for differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). In-depth neuropsychological assessment revealed specific dysfunctions in the two dementia syndromes. However, a significant overlap of cognitive impairments exists in early disease stages. We questioned whether a standard neuropsychological assessment at initial clinical presentation can delineate patients with AD versus bvFTD. METHODS In a retrospective approach, we evaluated and compared how cognitive profiles assessed at initial clinical presentation predicted the diagnosis of later verified AD (n = 43) and bvFTD (n = 26). Additionally, the neuropsychological standard domains memory, language, visuospatial skills, executive functions, praxis and social cognition were subjected to stepwise discriminant analysis to compare their differential contribution to diagnosis. RESULTS Regardless of diagnosis, a percentage of patients presented with major deterioration in a wide range of cognitive domains when compared with age-matched normative data. Only few significant differences were detected on the group level: Patients with AD were relatively more impaired in the verbal recall, verbal recognition, figure copy, and surprisingly in the executive subdomains, set shifting and processing speed whereas bvFTD was characterised by more deficits in imitation of face postures. A combination of tests for verbal recall, imitation of limb and face postures, and figure copy showed the greatest discriminatory power. CONCLUSIONS Our results imply that the contribution of a standard neuropsychological assessment is limited for differential diagnosis of AD and bvFTD at initial presentation. In contrast to current clinical guidelines, executive functions are neither particularly nor exclusively impaired in patients with bvFTD when assessed within a standard clinical neuropsychological test battery. The significant overlap of bvFTD and AD concerning the profile of cognitive impairments questions current neuropsychological diagnostic criteria and calls for revision, regarding both the degree and the profile of cognitive deficits.},

Twelve Spanish-English bilinguals with AD and 19 matched controls read-aloud 8 paragraphs in four conditions (a) English-only, (b) Spanish-only, (c) English-mixed (mostly English with 6 Spanish words), and (d) Spanish-mixed (mostly Spanish with 6 English words). Reading elicited language intrusions (e.g., saying la instead of the), and several types of within-language errors (e.g., saying their instead of the). Patients produced more intrusions (and self-corrected less often) than controls, particularly when reading non-dominant language paragraphs with switches into the dominant language. Patients also produced more within-language errors than controls, but differences between groups for these were not consistently larger with dominant versus non-dominant language targets. These results illustrate the potential utility of speech errors for diagnosis of AD, suggest a variety of linguistic and executive control impairments in AD, and reveal multiple cognitive mechanisms needed to mix languages fluently. The observed pattern of deficits, and unique sensitivity of intrusions to AD in bilinguals, suggests intact ability to select a default language with contextual support, to rapidly translate and switch languages in production of connected speech, but impaired ability to monitor language membership while regulating inhibitory control.},

Standardization of the test by administration to 63 normal elderly subjects and 137 patients (Sample B) indicated that the score of 20 or less was found essentially only in patients with dementia, delerium, schizophrenia or affective disorder and not in normal elderly people or in patients with a primary diagnosis of neurosis and personality disorder.

abstract = {The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) is used widely to identify very mild dementia; three alternative scoring procedures have been proposed based on free recall, total recall, and cue efficiency. We compared the predictive validity of these scoring procedures for the identification of very mild prevalent dementia (CDR=0.5), of incident dementia and for distinguishing AD and nonAD dementias. We tested 244 elderly African American and Caucasian primary care patients at 18 month intervals using a screening neuropsychological battery that included the FCSRT and a comprehensive diagnostic neuropsychological battery. Median follow-up was 2.6 years. Dementia diagnoses were assigned using standard criteria without access to the results of the screening battery. There were 50 prevalent and 28 incident dementia cases. At scores selected to provide specificities of 90{\%}, free recall was more sensitive to incident and prevalent dementia than the other two measures. Patients with impaired free recall were 15 times more likely to have a prevalent dementia and their risk of future dementia was four times higher than patients with intact free recall. Neither race nor education affected prediction though older patients were at increased risk of future dementia. Total recall was more impaired in AD dementia than in nonAD dementias. The results indicate that using the FCSRT, free recall is best measure for detecting prevalent dementia and predicting future dementia. Total recall impairment supports the diagnosis of AD rather than nonAD dementia.},

abstract = {Early diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is currently a challenge. Currently, MCI is diagnosed using specific clinical diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological examinations. As such we propose an automated diagnostic technique using a variant of deep neural networks language mod-els (DNNLM) on the verbal utterances of MCI pa-tients. Motivated by the success of DNNLM on natural language tasks, we propose a combination of deep neural network and deep language models (D2NNLM) to predict MCI. Results on the Demen-tiaBank language transcript clinical dataset show that D2NNLM sufficiently learned several linguis-tic biomarkers in the form of higher order n-grams and skip-grams to distinguish the MCI group from the healthy group with reasonable accuracy, which could help clinical diagnosis even in the absence of sufficient training data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The manual diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related Dementias has been a challenge. Currently, these disorders are diagnosed using specific clinical diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological examinations. The use of several Machine Learning algorithms to build automated diagnostic models using low-level linguistic features resulting from verbal utterances could aid diagnosis of patients with probable AD from a large population. For this purpose, we developed different Machine Learning models on the DementiaBank language transcript clinical dataset, consisting of 99 patients with probable AD and 99 healthy controls. RESULTS Our models learned several syntactic, lexical, and n-gram linguistic biomarkers to distinguish the probable AD group from the healthy group. In contrast to the healthy group, we found that the probable AD patients had significantly less usage of syntactic components and significantly higher usage of lexical components in their language. Also, we observed a significant difference in the use of n-grams as the healthy group were able to identify and make sense of more objects in their n-grams than the probable AD group. As such, our best diagnostic model significantly distinguished the probable AD group from the healthy elderly group with a better Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) using the Support Vector Machines (SVM). CONCLUSIONS Experimental and statistical evaluations suggest that using ML algorithms for learning linguistic biomarkers from the verbal utterances of elderly individuals could help the clinical diagnosis of probable AD. We emphasise that the best ML model for predicting the disease group combines significant syntactic, lexical and top n-gram features. However, there is a need to train the diagnostic models on larger datasets, which could lead to a better AUC and clinical diagnosis of probable AD.},

@article{Locke1997,
abstract = {This article offers a developmental theory of language and the neural systems that lead to and subserve linguistic capabilities. Early perceptual experience and discontinuities in linguistic development suggest that language develops in four phases that occur in a fixed, interdependent sequence. In each phase of language, a unique ontogenetic function is accomplished. These functions have proprietary neural systems that vary in their degree of specialization. Of particular interest is an analytical mechanism that is responsible for linguistic grammar. This mechanism is brae- locked and can only be turned on in the third phase. Confirming evidence is provided by children who are delayed in the second phase of the language learning process. These children store insufficient lexical material to activate their analytic mechanism. Inactivation behaves like damage, shifting language functions to homologous mechanisms in the nondominant hemisphere, thereby increasing functional and anatomical symmetry across the hemispheres. This atypical assembly of neurolinguistic resources produces functional but imperfect command of spoken language and may complicate learning of written language. The theory thus offers a different role for genetics and early experience, and a different interpretation of neuroanatomic findings, from those entertained in most other proposals on develop mental language disorders.},

Therefore, it is one of the most active research areas today. Alzheimer's disease is sometimes diagnosed by excluding other dementias, and definitive confirmation is only obtained through a postmortem study of the brain tissue of the patient. The work presented here is part of a larger study that aims to identify novel technologies and biomarkers for early AD detection, and it focuses on evaluating the suitability of a new approach for early diagnosis of AD by noninvasive methods. The purpose is to examine, in a pilot study, the potential of applying machine learning algorithms to speech features obtained from suspected Alzheimer's disease sufferers in order to help diagnose this disease and determine its degree of severity. Two human capabilities relevant in communication have been analyzed for feature selection: spontaneous speech and emotional response. The experimental results obtained were very satisfactory and promising for the early diagnosis and classification of AD patients.},

abstract = {Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a mental disorder difficult to diagnose. Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but this is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce non-grammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic correction of transcripts. In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually revised. Taken together, the results indicate that complex networks enriched with embedding is promising for detecting MCI in large-scale assessments},

abstract = {Objective: We constructed random forest classifiers employing either the traditional method of scoring semantic fluency word lists or new methods. These classifiers were then compared in terms of their ability to diagnose Alzheimer disease (AD) or to prognosticate among individuals along the continuum from cognitively normal (CN) through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Method: Semantic fluency lists from 44 cognitively normal elderly individuals, 80 MCI patients, and 41 AD patients were transcribed into electronic text files and scored by four methods: traditional raw scores, clustering and switching scores, "generalized" versions of clustering and switching, and a method based on independent components analysis (ICA). Random forest classifiers based on raw scores were compared to "augmented" classifiers that incorporated newer scoring methods. Outcome variables included AD diagnosis at baseline, MCI conversion, increase in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score, or decrease in Financial Capacity Instrument (FCI) score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for each classifier and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. We compared AUC between raw and augmented classifiers using Delong's test and assessed validity and reliability of the augmented classifier. Results: Augmented classifiers outperformed classifiers based on raw scores for the outcome measures AD diagnosis (AUC .97 vs .95), MCI conversion (AUC .91 vs .77), CDR-SOB increase (AUC .90 vs .79), and FCI decrease (AUC .89 vs .72). Measures of validity and stability over time support the use of the method. Conclusion: Latent information in semantic fluency word lists is useful for predicting cognitive and functional decline among elderly individuals at increased risk for developing AD. Modern machine learning methods may incorporate latent information to enhance the diagnostic value of semantic fluency raw scores. These methods could yield information valuable for patient care and clinical trial design with a relatively small investment of time and money. {\textcopyright} 2014 .},

The workgroup sought to ensure that the revised criteria would be flexible enough to be used by both general healthcare providers without access to neuropsychological testing, advanced imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid measures, and specialized investigators involved in research or in clinical trial studies who would have these tools available. We present criteria for all-cause dementia and for AD dementia. We retained the general framework of probable AD dementia from the 1984 criteria. On the basis of the past 27 years of experience, we made several changes in the clinical criteria for the diagnosis. We also retained the term possible AD dementia, but redefined it in a manner more focused than before. Biomarker evidence was also integrated into the diagnostic formulations for probable and possible AD dementia for use in research settings. The core clinical criteria for AD dementia will continue to be the cornerstone of the diagnosis in clinical practice, but biomarker evidence is expected to enhance the pathophysiological specificity of the diagnosis of AD dementia. Much work lies ahead for validating the biomarker diagnosis of AD dementia. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this study was to determine if participants with very early, subclinical memory declines were also showing declines in connected language. We analyzed connected language samples obtained from a simple picture description task at two time points in 264 participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). In parallel, participants were classified as either "Cognitively Healthy" or "Early Mild Cognitive Impairment" based on longitudinal neuropsychological test performance. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze language parameters that were extracted from the connected language samples using automated feature extraction. Participants with eMCI status declined faster in features of speech fluency and semantic content than those who were cognitively stable. Measures of lexical diversity and grammatical complexity were not associated with eMCI status in this group. These findings provide novel insights about the relationship between cognitive decline and everyday language, using a quick, inexpensive, and performance-based method.},

abstract = {Language assessment has a crucial role in the clinical diagnosis of several neurodegenerative diseases. The analysis of extended speech production is a precious source of information encompassing the phonetic, phonological, lexico-semantic, morpho-syntactic, and pragmatic levels of language organization. The knowledge about the distinctive linguistic variables identifying language deficits associated to different neurodegenerative diseases has progressively improved in the last years. However, the heterogeneity of such variables and of the way they are measured and classified limits any generalization and makes the comparison among studies difficult. Here we present an exhaustive review of the studies focusing on the linguistic variables derived from the analysis of connected speech samples, with the aim of characterizing the language disorders of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including primary progressive aphasia, Alzheimer's disease, movement disorders, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A total of 61 studies have been included, considering only those reporting group analysis and comparisons with a group of healthy persons. This review first analyzes the differences in the tasks used to elicit connected speech, namely picture description, story narration, and interview, considering the possible different contributions to the assessment of different linguistic domains. This is followed by an analysis of the terminologies and of the methods of measurements of the variables, indicating the need for harmonization and standardization. The final section reviews the linguistic domains affected by each different neurodegenerative disease, indicating the variables most consistently impaired at each level and suggesting the key variables helping in the differential diagnosis among diseases. While a large amount of valuable information is already available, the review highlights the need of further work, including the development of automated methods, to take advantage of the richness of connected speech analysis for both research and clinical purposes.},

abstract = {Objective: To identify qualitative and quantitative differences among the connected speech productions of patients with non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (naPPA), logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA), and semantic variant PPA (svPPA). Background: The core diagnostic features of naPPA are effortful, non-fluent speech and impaired production and comprehension of grammar. Patients with svPPA have a prominent impairment of semantics. lvPPA patients exhibit impaired word retrieval and slowed speech, without the conspicuous agrammatism seen in naPPA. We used a brief speech sample to differentiate among these groups. Design/Methods: We studied patients with nfaPPA (n=15), lvPPA (n=29), svPPA (n=11), behavioral-variant FTD (n=17), and healthy seniors (n=12). Up to 90 seconds of speech was recorded while subjects described the Cookie Theft scene. The recordings were transcribed and coded for fluency, grammar, and lexicon, employing well-defined, easily applied criteria. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of structural MRI images was available for a subset of PPA patients. Results: Patients with naPPA exhibited a dramatically reduced speech rate, produced the largest number of speech-sound errors, and exhibited the least grammatical complexity of all groups. lvPPA patients made few speech-sound errors, but they exhibited other disruptions to the flow of speech and also produced ungrammatical and incomplete sentences, with impaired lexical access. The only prominent impairment in svPPA was of lexical access. VBM analysis revealed a relation of slowed speech rate to left middle and inferior frontal regions and insula in naPPA and to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior portions of middle and superior temporal gyri in lvPPA. Lexical impairments were related to temporal regions in svPPA. Conclusions: PPA patient groups differ qualitatively on measures of fluency, grammar, and lexical retrieval, which may help distinguish them. Their speech impairments are associated with atrophy in different portions of a left hemisphere language network.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various types of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are manifested as irregularities in human speech and language, which have proven to be strong predictors for the disease presence and progress ion. Therefore, automatic speech analytics provided by a mobile application may be a useful tool in providing additional indicators for assessment and detection of early stage dementia and MCI., METHOD: 165 participants (subjects with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), MCI patients, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mixed dementia (MD) patients) were recorded with a mobile application while performing several short vocal cognitive tasks during a regular consultation. These tasks included verbal fluency, picture description, counting down and a free speech task. The voice recordings were processed in two steps: in the first step, vocal markers were extracted using speech signal processing techniques; in the second, the vocal markers were tested to assess their 'power' to distinguish between SCI, MCI, AD and MD. The second step included training automatic classifiers for detecting MCI and AD, based on machine learning methods, and testing the detection accuracy., RESULTS: The fluency and free speech tasks obtain the highest accuracy rates of classifying AD vs. MD vs. MCI vs. SCI. Using the data, we demonstrated classification accuracy as follows: SCI vs. AD = 92{\%} accuracy; SCI vs. MD = 92{\%} accuracy; SCI vs. MCI = 86{\%} accuracy and MCI vs. AD = 86{\%}., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the potential value of vocal analytics and the use of a mobile application for accurate automatic differentiation between SCI, MCI and AD. This tool can provide the clinician with meaningful information for assessment and monitoring of people with MCI and AD based on a non-invasive, simple and low-cost method.Copyright{\textcopyright} Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.},

Connected speech analysis provides the most realistic measure of language function but its use has been restricted by operational constraints.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Language change can be a valuable biological marker of overall cognitive change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia. Previous reports have described increased use of language formulas in AD, i.e., combinations likely processed in a holistic manner. Words that commonly occur together are more likely to become a formula. OBJECTIVE: To determine if frequency of co-occurrence as one indicator for formulaic language can distinguish people with probable AD from controls and if variables are sensitive to time post-symptom onset. METHODS: We developed the Frequency in Language Analysis Tool (FLAT), which indicates degrees of formulaicity in an individual language sample. The FLAT accomplishes this by comparing individual language samples to co-occurrence data from the British National Corpus (BNC). Our analysis also contained more conventional language variables in order to assess novel contributions of the FLAT. We analyzed data from the Pitt Corpus, which is part of DementiaBank. RESULTS: Both conventional and co-occurrence variables were able to distinguish AD and control groups. According to co-occurrence data, people with probable AD produced more formulaic language than controls. Only co-occurrence variables correlated with disease progression. DISCUSSION: Frequency of word co-occurrences is one indicator for formulaicity and a valuable contribution to characterizing language change in AD.},

abstract = {The ways people use words in their daily lives can provide rich information about their beliefs, fears, thinking patterns, social relationships, and personalities. From the time of Freud's writings about slips of the tongue to the early days of computer­based text analysis, researchers began amassing increasingly compelling evidence that the words we use have tremendous psychological value (Gottschalk {\&} Glaser, 1969; Stone, Dunphy, Smith, {\&} Ogilvie, 1966; Weintraub, 1989). Although promising, the early computer methods floundered because of the sheer complexity of the task. Extensive samples of text were not digitized, computers were slow and unwieldy, and there was little agreement about which features of natural language were most related to psychological states. Everything changed in the 1990s with the advent of efficient desktop computers, improved data storage technology, and the explosion of the internet. These factors allowed for the easy collection of large stores of books, conversations, and other digitized text samples. In order to provide an efficient and effective method for studying the various emotional, cognitive, and structural components present in individuals' verbal and written speech samples, we originally developed a text analysis application called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, or LIWC. The first LIWC application was developed as part of an exploratory study of language and disclosure (Francis, 1993; Pennebaker, 1993). The second (LIWC2001) and third (LIWC2007) versions updated the original application with an expanded dictionary and a more modern software design (Pennebaker, Francis, {\&} Booth, 2001; Pennebaker, Booth, {\&} Francis, 2007). The most recent evolution, LIWC2015 (Pennebaker, Booth, Boyd, {\&} Francis, 2015), has significantly altered both the dictionary and the software options. Importantly, the LIWC2015 software and dictionary are new, rather than a basic update to previous versions of LIWC. As with previous versions, however, the program is designed to analyze individual or multiple language files quickly and efficiently. At the same time, the program attempts to be transparent and flexible in its operation, allowing the user to explore word use in multiple ways.},

abstract = {Narrative speech can provide a valuable source of infor- mation about an individual's linguistic abilities across lexical, syntactic, and pragmatic levels. However, analysis of narrative speech is typically done by hand, and is therefore extremely time-consuming. Use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) software could make this type of analysis more efficient and widely available. In this paper, we present the results of an initial attempt to use ASR technology to generate transcripts of spoken narratives from participants with semantic dementia (SD), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and healthy con- trols. We extract text features from the transcripts and use these features, alone and in combination with acoustic features from the speech signals, to classify transcripts as patient versus con- trol, and SD versus PNFA. Additionally, we generate artificially noisy transcripts by applying insertions, substitutions, and dele- tions to manually-transcribed data, allowing experiments to be conducted across a wider range of noise levels than are pro- duced by a tuned ASR system. We find that reasonably good classification accuracies can be achieved by selecting appropri- ate features from the noisy transcripts. We also find that the choice of using ASR data or manually transcribed data as the training set can have a strong effect on the accuracy of the clas- sifiers.},

abstract = {Current methods of assessing dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) in older adults involve structured interviews that attempt to capture the complex nature of deficits suffered. One of the most significant areas affected by the disease is the capacity for functional communication as linguistic skills break down. These methods often do note capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. We address this issue by exploring novel automatic and objective methods for diagnosing patients through analysis of spontaneous speech. We detail several lexical approaches to the problem of detecting and rating DAT. The approaches explored rely on character n-gram-based techniques, shown recently to perform successfully in a different, but related task of automatic authorship attribution. We also explore the correlation of usage frequency of different parts of speech and DAT. We achieve a high 95{\%} accuracy of detecting dementia when compared with a control group, and we achieve 70{\%} accuracy in rating dementia in two classes, and 50{\%} accuracy in rating dementia into four classes. Our results show that purely computational solutions offer a viable alternative to standard approaches to diagnosing the level of impairment in patients. These results are significant step forward toward automatic and objective means to identifying early symptoms of DAT in older adults.},

With this as a starting point, we investigate the relation between SVF results and MMSE/CDR-SOB scores. We use regression models to predict scores based on persons' SVF performance. Over a set of 179 patients with different degree of dementia, we achieve a mean absolute error of of 2.2 for MMSE (range 0–30) and 1.7 for CDR-SOB (range 0–18). True and predicted scores agree with a Cohen's $\kappa$ of 0.76 for MMSE and 0.52 for CDR-SOB. We conclude that our approach has potential to serve as a cheap dementia},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce and discuss a concept of syntactic n-grams (sn-grams). Sn-grams differ from traditional n-grams in the manner how we construct them, i.e., what elements are considered neighbors. In case of sn-grams, the neighbors are taken by following syntactic relations in syntactic trees, and not by taking words as they appear in a text, i.e., sn-grams are constructed by following paths in syntactic trees. In this manner, sn-grams allow bringing syntactic knowledge into machine learning methods; still, previous parsing is necessary for their construction. Sn-grams can be applied in any natural language processing (NLP) task where traditional n-grams are used. We describe how sn-grams were applied to authorship attribution. We used as baseline traditional n-grams of words, part of speech (POS) tags and characters; three classifiers were applied: support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), and tree classifier J48. Sn-grams give better results with SVM classifier. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if linguistic ability in early life is associated with cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease in late life. DESIGN: Two measures of linguistic ability in early life, idea density and grammatical complexity, were derived from autobiographies written at a mean age of 22 years. Approximately 58 years later, the women who wrote these autobiographies participated in an assessment of cognitive function, and those who subsequently died were evaluated neuropathologically. SETTING: Convents in the United States participating in the Nun Study; primarily convents in the Milwaukee, Wis, area. PARTICIPANTS: Cognitive function was investigated in 93 participants who were aged 75 to 95 years at the time of their assessments, and Alzheimer's disease was investigated in the 14 participants who died at 79 to 96 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seven neuropsychological tests and neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Low idea density and low grammatical complexity in autobiographies written in early life were associated with low cognitive test scores in late life. Low idea density in early life had stronger and more consistent associations with poor cognitive function than did low grammatical complexity. Among the 14 sisters who died, neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease was present in all of those with low idea density in early life and in none of those with high idea density. CONCLUSIONS: Low linguistic ability in early life was a strong predictor of poor cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease in late life.},

The language samples were scored for grammatical complexity and propositional content. For the healthy group, age-related declines in grammatical complexity and propositional content were observed. The declines were most rapid in the mid 70s. For the group with dementia, grammatical complexity and propositional content also declined over time, regardless of age. Rates of decline were uniform across individuals. These analyses reveal how both grammatical complexity and propositional content are related to late-life changes in cognition in healthy older adults aswell as those with dementia.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Dementia is a complex disorder characterized by poor outcomes for the patients and high costs of care. After decades of research little is known about its mechanisms. Having prognostic estimates about dementia can help researchers, patients and public entities in dealing with this disorder. Thus, health data, machine learning and microsimulation techniques could be employed in developing prognostic estimates for dementia. OBJECTIVE The goal of this paper is to present evidence on the state of the art of studies investigating and the prognosis of dementia using machine learning and microsimulation techniques. METHOD To achieve our goal we carried out a systematic literature review, in which three large databases-Pubmed, Socups and Web of Science were searched to select studies that employed machine learning or microsimulation techniques for the prognosis of dementia. A single backward snowballing was done to identify further studies. A quality checklist was also employed to assess the quality of the evidence presented by the selected studies, and low quality studies were removed. Finally, data from the final set of studies were extracted in summary tables. RESULTS In total 37 papers were included. The data summary results showed that the current research is focused on the investigation of the patients with mild cognitive impairment that will evolve to Alzheimer's disease, using machine learning techniques. Microsimulation studies were concerned with cost estimation and had a populational focus. Neuroimaging was the most commonly used variable. CONCLUSIONS Prediction of conversion from MCI to AD is the dominant theme in the selected studies. Most studies used ML techniques on Neuroimaging data. Only a few data sources have been recruited by most studies and the ADNI database is the one most commonly used. Only two studies have investigated the prediction of epidemiological aspects of Dementia using either ML or MS techniques. Finally, care should be taken when interpreting the reported accuracy of ML techniques, given studies' different contexts.},

abstract = {Oral and written picture descriptions were compared in 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 24 healthy elderly subjects. AD patients had a significant reduction of all word categories, which, similarly to controls, was more pronounced in written than in oral texts. They also reported fewer information units than controls, but without task difference. At the syntactic level, written descriptions of AD subjects were characterized by a diminution of subordinate clauses and a reduction of functors. More grammatical errors were present in written descriptions by AD and control subjects. AD and control groups produced an equivalent number of semantic errors in both tasks. However, in oral description, AD patients had more word-finding difficulties. In sum, AD descriptions were always shorter and less informative than control texts. Additionally, written descriptions of AD patients appeared shorter and more syntactically simplified than, but as informative as, oral descriptions. Whereas no phonemic paraphasias were observed in either group, AD patients produced many more graphemic paragraphias than controls produced. Furthermore, written descriptions had more irrelevant semantic intrusions. Thus, as compared to oral descriptions, written texts appeared to be a more reliable test of semantic and linguistics difficulties in AD.},

In particular, we show that it is probable that Agatha Christie indeed suffered from the onset of Alzheimer's while writing her last novels, and that Iris Murdoch exhibited a ‘trough' of relatively impoverished vocabulary and syntax in her writing in her late 40s and 50s that presaged her later dementia.},

The FCSRT involves the use of selective reminding with semantic cueing in memory assessment. This study aims to validate the FCSRT for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD through the analysis of the diagnostic accuracy and the suggestion of cut-off scores. Patients were classified into two groups according to standard criteria: MCI (n = 100) and AD (n = 70). A matched control group (n = 101) of cognitively healthy subjects was included. The reliability and the validity of the FCSRT were analysed on the immediate (IR) and delayed (DR) recalls. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.915 for the IR and 0.879 for the DR. The total recall measures revealed good areas under the curve for MCI (IR: .818; DR: .828) and excellent for AD (IR: .987; DR: .991). Furthermore, the MCI group was subdivided with respect to a non-similar/similar AD pattern of impairment, with almost half of the subjects showing an AD-like decline. This analysis represents a novel contribution regarding the properties of the FCSRT in illustrating the heterogeneity of MCI at baseline. The FCSRT has proved to be a very useful tool in the characterization of the memory impairment of the AD spectrum.},

abstract = {A better knowledge of long-term trajectories of cognitive decline is a central feature of the study of the process leading to Alzheimer's dementia. Several factors may mitigate such decline, among which is education, a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The aim of our work was to compare the pattern and duration of clinical trajectories before Alzheimer's dementia in individuals with low and high education within the PAQUID cohort involving 20 years of follow-up. The sample comprises 442 participants with incident Alzheimer's disease (27.2{\%} were male)--171 with low education (mean age=86.2 years; standard deviation=5.3 years) and 271 with higher education (mean age=86.5; standard deviation=5.4)--and 442 control subjects matched according to age, sex and education. At each visit and up to the 20-year follow-up visit, several cognitive and clinical measures were collected and incident cases of Alzheimer's disease clinically diagnosed. The evolution of clinical measures in pre-demented subjects and matched controls was analysed with a semi-parametric extension of the mixed effects linear model. The results show that the first signs of cognitive decline occurred 15 to 16 years before achieving dementia threshold in higher-educated subjects whereas signs occurred at 7 years before dementia in low-educated subjects. There seemed to be two successive periods of decline in higher-educated subjects. Decline started ∼15 to 16 years before dementia with subtle impairment restricted to some cognitive tests and with no impact during the first 7 to 8 years on global cognition, cognitive complaints, or activities of daily living scales. Then, ∼7 years before dementia, global cognitive abilities begin to deteriorate, along with difficulties dealing with complex activities of daily living, the increase in self-perceived difficulties and depressive symptoms. By contrast, lower-educated subjects presented a single period of decline lasting ∼7 years, characterized by decline concomitantly affecting specific and more global cognitive function along with alteration in functional abilities. This study demonstrates how early cognitive symptoms may emerge preceding Alzheimer's dementia particularly in higher-educated individuals, for whom decline occurred up to 16 years before dementia. It also demonstrates the protective role of education in the clinical trajectory preceding Alzheimer's dementia. We suggest that the initial decline in cognition occurs at the onset of comparable Alzheimer's disease pathology in both groups, and is associated with immediate decline to dementia in the lower education group. In contrast, higher education protects against further cognitive decline for ∼7 years until pathology becomes more severe.},

As a result, persons with dementia are missing important clinical care and treatment interventions. By distinction, the problems of defining, diagnosing, and treating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are not yet resolved, and MCI is not ready for a screening recommendation. Dementia screening approaches, including cognitive testing and functional assessment, must be evaluated on their scientific merits, including sensitivity and specificity for recognizing affected individuals in at-risk populations. Screening tests must be "cost-worthy", with the benefits of true-positive test results justifying the costs of testing and resolving false-positive cases, with due consideration for proper diagnostic evaluation and potential harms. With the tremendous number of new cases projected in the near future and the expected emergence of beneficial therapies, considerably more research is needed to develop more efficient screening systems. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Alzheimer's Association.},

A total of 342 cases was negative in the Gallyas stain but when restaged for AT8 only 10 were immunonegative. Fifty-eight cases had subcortical tau predominantly in the locus coeruleus, but there was no abnormal cortical tau (subcortical Stages a-c). Cortical involvement (abnormal tau in neurites) was identified first in the transentorhinal region (Stage 1a, 38 cases). Transentorhinal pyramidal cells displayed pretangle material (Stage 1b, 236 cases). Pretangles gradually became argyrophilic neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that progressed in parallel with NFT Stages I to VI. Pretangles restricted to subcortical sites were seen chiefly at younger ages. Of the total cases, 1,031 (44.2{\%}) had $\beta$-amyloid plaques. The first plaques occurred in the neocortex after the onset of tauopathy in the brainstem. Plaques generally developed in the 40s in 4{\%} of all cases, culminating in their tenth decade (75{\%}). $\beta$-amyloid plaques and NFTs were significantly correlated (p {\textless} 0.0001). These data suggest that tauopathy associated with sporadic Alzheimer disease may begin earlier than previously thought and possibly in the lower brainstem rather than in the transentorhinal region.},

METHOD The BPA is based on a conceptualization of cognition as being comprised of multiple processes, the nature of which could not possibly be captured by a single score on a test or battery of tests. Identification of these processes is only possible with careful observation of an individual during the entire testing process to determine how, when, and why a person fails, which helps to reveal the integrity of the cognitive processes underlying the behavior. RESULTS BPA use within the Framingham Heart Study is described, including how digital technology has been incorporated to enhance the sensitivity of BPA to detect insidious onset changes even earlier than had been previously possible. The digital technology movement will dramatically alter the means by which cognitive function is assessed going forward. CONCLUSIONS Technological advances will catalyze groundbreaking discoveries for effective treatments of neurodegenerative cognitive disorders, such as AD, and inform novel strategies for dementia prevention and sustained lifelong cognitive health.

But does it differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases? Methods We assessed the FCSRT and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in 992 cases. Experts, blinded to biomarker data, attributed in 650 cases a diagnosis of typical AD, frontotemporal dementia, posterior cortical atrophy, Lewy body disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, primary progressive aphasias, “subjective cognitive decline,” or depression. Results The FCSRT distinguished typical AD from all other conditions with a sensitivity of 100{\%} and a specificity of 75{\%}. Non-AD neurodegenerative diseases with positive AD CSF biomarkers (“atypical AD”) did not have lower FCSRT scores than those with negative biomarkers. Discussion The FCSRT is a reliable tool for diagnosing typical AD among various neurodegenerative diseases. At an individual level, however, its specificity is not absolute. Our findings also widen the spectrum of atypical AD to multiple neurodegenerative conditions.},

abstract = {Demyelination is a common pathologic feature in many neurodegenerative diseases including infection with leprosy-causing Mycobacterium leprae. Because of the long incubation time and highly complex disease pathogenesis, the management of nerve damage in leprosy, as in other demyelinating diseases, is extremely difficult. Therefore, an important challenge in therapeutic interventions is to identify the molecular events that occur in the early phase before the progression of the disease. Here we provide evidence that M. leprae-induced demyelination is a result of direct bacterial ligation to and activation of ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling without ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization, a previously unknown mechanism that bypasses the neuregulin-ErbB3-mediated ErbB2 phosphorylation. MEK-dependent Erk1 and Erk2 (hereafter referred to as Erk1/2) signaling is identified as a downstream target of M. leprae-induced ErbB2 activation that mediates demyelination. Herceptin (trastuzumab), a therapeutic humanized ErbB2-specific antibody, inhibits M. leprae binding to and activation of ErbB2 and Erk1/2 in human primary Schwann cells, and the blockade of ErbB2 activity by the small molecule dual ErbB1-ErbB2 kinase inhibitor PKI-166 (ref. 11) effectively abrogates M. leprae-induced myelin damage in in vitro and in vivo models. These results may have implications for the design of ErbB2 RTK-based therapies for both leprosy nerve damage and other demyelinating neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Introduction Trials in Alzheimer's disease are increasingly focusing on prevention in asymptomatic individuals. We hypothesized that indicators of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be present in the content of spoken language in older adults and be useful in distinguishing those with MCI from those who are cognitively intact. To test this hypothesis, we performed linguistic analyses of spoken words in participants with MCI and those with intact cognition participating in a clinical trial. Methods Data came from a randomized controlled behavioral clinical trial to examine the effect of unstructured conversation on cognitive function among older adults with either normal cognition or MCI (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01571427). Unstructured conversations (but with standardized preselected topics across subjects) were recorded between interviewers and interviewees during the intervention sessions of the trial from 14 MCI and 27 cognitively intact participants. From the transcription of interviewees recordings, we grouped spoken words using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a structured table of words, which categorizes 2500 words into 68 different word subcategories such as positive and negative words, fillers, and physical states. The number of words in each LIWC word subcategory constructed a vector of 68 dimensions representing the linguistic features of each subject. We used support vector machine and random forest classifiers to distinguish MCI from cognitively intact participants. Results MCI participants were distinguished from those with intact cognition using linguistic features obtained by LIWC with 84{\%} classification accuracy which is well above chance 60{\%}. Discussion Linguistic analyses of spoken language may be a powerful tool in distinguishing MCI subjects from those with intact cognition. Further studies to assess whether spoken language derived measures could detect changes in cognitive functions in clinical trials are warrented.},

The purpose is to examine in a pilot study the potential of applying intelligent algorithms to speech features obtained from suspected patients in order to contribute to the improvement of diagnosis of AD and its degree of severity. In this sense, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been used for the automatic classification of the two classes (AD and control subjects). Two human issues have been analyzed for feature selection: Spontaneous Speech and Emotional Response. Not only linear features but also non-linear ones, such as Fractal Dimension, have been explored. The approach is non invasive, low cost and without any side effects. Obtained experimental results were very satisfactory and promising for early diagnosis and classification of AD patients.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Literature-based discovery systems aim at discovering valuable latent connections between previously disparate research areas. This is achieved by analyzing the contents of their respective literatures with the help of various intelligent computational techniques. In this paper, we review the progress of literature-based discovery research, focusing on understanding their technical features and evaluating their performance. The present literature-based discovery techniques can be divided into two general approaches: the traditional approach and the emerging approach. The traditional approach, which dominate the current research landscape, comprises mainly of techniques that rely on utilizing lexical statistics, knowledge-based and visualization methods in order to address literature-based discovery problems. On the other hand, we have also observed the births of new trends and unprecedented paradigm shifts among the recently emerging literature-based discovery approach. These trends are likely to shape the future trajectory of the next generation literature-based discovery systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Background: There has been increasing interest in dementia care in recent years, including how practitioners, service providers and society in general can help individuals to live well with the condition. An important aspect to this is provision of advice to ensure conversation partners effectively support the person with dementia in conversation. Aims: To provide a descriptive review of the literature examining everyday conversation in dementia in order to inform practice and research. Methods {\&} Procedures: This review used a method specifically developed for reviewing conversation analytic and related literature. A range of databases were searched using key words and explicitly described inclusion criteria leading to a final corpus of 50 titles. Using this qualitative methodology, each paper was examined and data extracted. The contribution of each of these is described and the implications for practice and research are outlined. Main Contribution: This review examined studies into conversation in Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia, grouping these into: early influential studies; work drawing on positioning theory; studies using social and linguistic approaches; collaborative storytelling; formulaic language; studies specifically using conversation analysis; and conversation as a target for individualized therapy. In addition, more recent work examining primary progressive aphasia and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia was explored. Overall, this review indicates that research examining conversation in natural settings provides a rich source of data to explore not just the challenges within conversation for those taking part, but also the skills retained by the person with dementia. An important aspect of this understanding is the notion that these skills relate not only to information exchange but also aspects of social interaction. The role of others in scaffolding the conversation abilities of the person with dementia and the potential of this for developing interventions are discussed. Conclusions {\&} Implications: The review indicates that interventions targeting conversation in dementia are often advocated in the literature but currently such approaches remain to be systematically evaluated. In addition, many of the important insights arising from these studies have yet to inform multidisciplinary dementia care practice. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject? There is an increasing interest globally in providing effective support for people with dementia and their family members. An important aspect to this consists of those interventions aimed at enhancing conversation in everyday life. Currently there are few reviews examining everyday conversation in dementia. Literature examining this area can be found in diverse fields and journals, meaning it can be difficult for the researcher or practitioner to gain an overview of work in this area. What this paper adds The review aims to identify, organize and translate systematically what is currently known about everyday conversation in dementia into a useable resource to inform practitioners and researchers of all disciplines. This study, therefore, provides a descriptive review of the literature to date, including how this currently impacts on dementia care and makes recommendations for future practice and research. Research examining conversation in natural settings provides a rich source of data to explore not just the challenges within conversation for those taking part, but also the skills retained by the person with dementia. These skills relate to information exchange and aspects of social interaction. Conversation partners have a crucial role in scaffolding the conversation abilities of the person with dementia. There is potential for developing interventions around conversation, however, dementia care has so far not exploited such approaches in research or practice.},

abstract = {This pilot study evaluates the ability of machined learned algorithms to assist with the differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes based on brief ({\textless} 10 min) spontaneous speech samples. We ana-lyzed 1 recordings of a brief spontaneous speech sample from 48 participants from 5 different groups: 4 types of dementia plus healthy con-trols. Recordings were analyzed using a speech recognition system optimized for speaker-independent spontaneous speech. Lexical and acoustic features were automatically extracted. The resulting feature profiles were used as input to a machine learning system that was trained to identify the diagnosis assigned to each research participant. Between groups lexical and acoustic differences features were detected in accordance with expectations from prior research literature suggesting that classifications were based on fea-tures consistent with human-observed sympto-matology. Machine learning algorithms were able to identify participants' diagnostic group with accuracy comparable to existing diagnostic methods in use today. Results suggest this clini-cal speech analytic approach offers promise as an additional, objective and easily obtained source of diagnostic information for clinicians.},
