abstract = {The Global Observatory for Ageing and Dementia Care, hosted at the Health Service and Population Research Department, King's College London, was founded in 2013. Supported by Alzheimer's Disease International, and King's College London, the Observatory has a tripartite mission: 1. To build upon ADI's 10/66 Dementia Research Group program of population-based and intervention research in low and middle income countries, maximising the impact that research findings from our data can have upon policy and practice. 2. To develop, evaluate, and promote primary care and community interventions for people with dementia. 3. To synthesise global evidence for policymakers and public, in particular, continuing and developing our role in the preparation of high impact evidence-based reports for Alzheimer's Disease International (World Alzheimer Reports 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014, and Nutrition and dementia), the World Health Organization (Dementia: a public health priority, 2012) and other relevant intergovernmental organisations. The World Alzheimer Report 2015 was independently researched and authored by Prof Martin Prince, Prof Anders Wimo, Dr Ma{\"{e}}lenn Guerchet, Gemma-Claire Ali, Dr YuTzu Wu and Dr Matthew Prina, with contributions from others as listed. The evidence reported in Chapters 1-6, and the inferences drawn, are the responsibility of the authors alone. Chapter 7 was developed by the Global Observatory and Alzheimer's Disease International.},

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) manifests as memory impairment in the absence of dementia and progresses to Alzheimer's disease (AD) at a rate of around 15{\%} per annum, versus 1-2{\%} in the general population. It thus constitutes a primary target for investigation of early markers of AD. Language deficits occur early in AD, and performance on verbal tasks is an important diagnostic criterion for both AD and MCI. We review language performance in MCI, compare these findings to those seen in AD, and identify the primary issues in understanding language performance in MCI and selecting tasks with diagnostic and prognostic value.},

abstract = {Language assessment has a crucial role in the clinical diagnosis of several neurodegenerative diseases. The analysis of extended speech production is a precious source of information encompassing the phonetic, phonological, lexico-semantic, morpho-syntactic, and pragmatic levels of language organization. The knowledge about the distinctive linguistic variables identifying language deficits associated to different neurodegenerative diseases has progressively improved in the last years. However, the heterogeneity of such variables and of the way they are measured and classified limits any generalization and makes the comparison among studies difficult. Here we present an exhaustive review of the studies focusing on the linguistic variables derived from the analysis of connected speech samples, with the aim of characterizing the language disorders of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including primary progressive aphasia, Alzheimer's disease, movement disorders, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A total of 61 studies have been included, considering only those reporting group analysis and comparisons with a group of healthy persons. This review first analyzes the differences in the tasks used to elicit connected speech, namely picture description, story narration, and interview, considering the possible different contributions to the assessment of different linguistic domains. This is followed by an analysis of the terminologies and of the methods of measurements of the variables, indicating the need for harmonization and standardization. The final section reviews the linguistic domains affected by each different neurodegenerative disease, indicating the variables most consistently impaired at each level and suggesting the key variables helping in the differential diagnosis among diseases. While a large amount of valuable information is already available, the review highlights the need of further work, including the development of automated methods, to take advantage of the richness of connected speech analysis for both research and clinical purposes.},

abstract = {Changes in some lexical features of language have been associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Here we describe a method to extract key features from discourse transcripts, which we evaluated on non-scripted news conferences from President Ronald Reagan, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, and President George Herbert Walker Bush, who has no known diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Key word counts previously associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease were extracted and regression analyses were conducted. President Reagan showed a significant reduction in the number of unique words over time and a significant increase in conversational fillers and non-specific nouns over time. There was no significant trend in these features for President Bush.},

abstract = {Some of the factors involved in the choice of field strength for NMR imaging are examined. The influences of relaxation times and chemical shift upon image quality and signal-to-noise ratio are highlighted, and power deposition is introduced as a significant factor which may limit the flexibility and information available at higher fields as long as 180 degrees echo pulses continue to be necessary. Chemical-shift imaging is examined and found wanting as a means of coping with chemical-shift artifacts, and the use of multiple echoes (albeit with research) in conjunction with multiple-slice techniques is advocated as representing an efficient data-gathering scheme which can improve image signal-to-noise ratio. With such use, a medium field strength (0.5-1 T) is presented as representing, for general purpose imaging of head and torso, the best current compromise when imaging time is of major importance, with the important caveat that new techniques may always invalidate this conclusion.},
