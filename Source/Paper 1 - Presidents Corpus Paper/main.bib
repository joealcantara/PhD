Key word counts previously associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease were extracted and regression analyses were conducted. President Reagan showed a significant reduction in the number of unique words over time and a significant increase in conversational fillers and non-specific nouns over time.

abstract = {This study examines the impact of progressive degeneration of conceptual knowledge on the content words used in connected speech elicited using the Cookie Theft picture description (Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983). We began with an analysis of control subjects' descriptions with regard to word types and their frequency and imageability. Because the impairment of conceptual knowledge in semantic dementia is graded by concept familiarity, we created a model of a standardized normal Cookie Theft description that was then progressively degraded by the systematic removal of lower bands of word frequency. We drew two main predictions from this model: reduced availability of the lower bands of word frequency should result in (a) an apparent deficit for noun retrieval in relation to verb retrieval and (b) an apparent reverse imageability effect. Results from a longitudinal study, in which three patients with semantic dementia each described the Cookie Theft picture on three occasions during the progression of their disease, confirmed these predictions. An additional cross-sectional analysis, adding narratives from a larger number of cases, demonstrated that the decline in ability to produce suitable words for the picture description is closely related to the extent of semantic impairment as measured in tests of word comprehension and production. Both verbs and nouns are affected by the degradation of semantic memory; the fact that the impairment to noun production is manifested earlier and more catastrophically may be attributed to the relatively lower frequency of these terms.

abstract = {Generalized additive models (GAMs) have distinct advantages over generalized linear models as they allow investigators to make inferences about associations between outcomes and predictors without placing parametric restrictions on the associations. The variable of interest is often smoothed using a locally weighted regression (LOESS) and the optimal span (degree of smoothing) can be determined by minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A natural hypothesis when using GAMs is to test whether the smoothing term is necessary or if a simpler model would suffice. The statistic of interest is the difference in deviances between models including and excluding the smoothed term. As approximate chi-square tests of this hypothesis are known to be biased, permutation tests are a reasonable alternative. We compare the type I error rates of the chi-square test and of three permutation test methods using synthetic data generated under the null hypothesis. In each permutation method a distribution of differences in deviances is obtained from 999 permuted datasets and the null hypothesis is rejected if the observed statistic falls in the upper 5{\%} of the distribution. One test is a conditional permutation test using the optimal span size for the observed data; this span size is held constant for all permutations. This test is shown to have an inflated type I error rate. Alternatively, the span size can be fixed a priori such that the span selection technique is not reliant on the observed data. This test is shown to be unbiased; however, the choice of span size is not clear. A third method is an unconditional permutation test where the optimal span size is selected for observed and permuted datasets. This test is unbiased though computationally intensive.},

One of the most significant areas affected by the disease is the capacity for functional communication as linguistic skills break down. These methods often do note capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. We address this issue by exploring novel automatic and objective methods for diagnosing patients through analysis of spontaneous speech. We detail several lexical approaches to the problem of detecting and rating DAT. The approaches explored rely on character n-gram-based techniques, shown recently to perform successfully in a different, but related task of automatic authorship attribution. We also explore the correlation of usage frequency of different parts of speech and DAT. We achieve a high 95{\%} accuracy of detecting dementia when compared with a control group, and we achieve 70{\%} accuracy in rating dementia in two classes, and 50{\%} accuracy in rating dementia into four classes. Our results show that purely computational solutions offer a viable alternative to standard approaches to diagnosing the level of impairment in patients. These results are significant step forward toward automatic and objective means to identifying early symptoms of DAT in older adults.},

The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the use of non-linear elements, like varactor diodes or variable capacitor or an inductor on iron core material in the transmission line model in Miller form to produce negative group delay. The reason for choosing the Miller form loading is the practical simplicity of realizing these transmission line models on microstrip. Two different types of loadings are considered in this paper, one with the non-linear capacitor and other with the non-linear inductor. The gain for a unit cell of this model is obtained and the group delay and phase delay has been analyzed. After the analysis, is observed that the non-linear elements can produce the opposite delays in the circuit models. {\textcopyright} Research India Publications.},

abstract = {Background: The manual diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related Dementias has been a challenge. Currently, these disorders are diagnosed using specific clinical diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological examinations. The use of several Machine Learning algorithms to build automated diagnostic models using low-level linguistic features resulting from verbal utterances could aid diagnosis of patients with probable AD from a large population. For this purpose, we developed different Machine Learning models on the DementiaBank language transcript clinical dataset, consisting of 99 patients with probable AD and 99 healthy controls. Results: Our models learned several syntactic, lexical, and n-gram linguistic biomarkers to distinguish the probable AD group from the healthy group. In contrast to the healthy group, we found that the probable AD patients had significantly less usage of syntactic components and significantly higher usage of lexical components in their language. Also, we observed a significant difference in the use of n-grams as the healthy group were able to identify and make sense of more objects in their n-grams than the probable AD group. As such, our best diagnostic model significantly distinguished the probable AD group from the healthy elderly group with a better Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) using the Support Vector Machines (SVM). Conclusions: Experimental and statistical evaluations suggest that using ML algorithms for learning linguistic biomarkers from the verbal utterances of elderly individuals could help the clinical diagnosis of probable AD. We emphasise that the best ML model for predicting the disease group combines significant syntactic, lexical and top n-gram features. However, there is a need to train the diagnostic models on larger datasets, which could lead to a better AUC and clinical diagnosis of probable AD.},

If planners are to be sensitive to these processes, they must be attentive to four dimensions of their practice: a cognitive geography of knowledge production, a political-legal geography of power and consent, a ritual geography of social identity, and an economic-resource geography of attention. Recognizing this structure and field of practical action, planners may enhance social learning, resisting threats to democratizing movements, in part by distinguishing and protecting learning processes in two dimensions, the technical and the practical. Refusing to reduce issues of normative ambiguity to issues of technical uncertainty, planners may themselves continue to learn about the political and normative aspects of their practice and so foster democratic social-learning processes. -from Author},

abstract = {Background Spoken language in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an increasing use of pronouns. This causes a negative impact on daily communication as the number of unresolvable pronouns also increases. The few studies, which observed the development of language use in preclinical stages, found subtle differences even decades before an AD diagnosis. We analyzed in our study the use of pronouns in the course of up to 12 years before early stages of AD. Methods We evaluated a subset (n=16,16,10) of the semi-standardized biographical interviews of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on Adult Development and Aging (ILSE) which has been observed at three times (t1: 1993/94, t2: 1997/98, t3: 2005/07). We selected subjects being cognitively healthy at t1 and developed AD at t3 as well as well matched healthy controls. The extensive interviews (1.5-4.5 hours) were transcribed. Part of speech was annotated automatically using TreeTagger. Differences in frequency of pronouns were calculated with the Mann-Whitney U test. Additionally correlations between pronoun use and cognitive performance were assessed. Results AD patients and controls do not differ significantly in pronoun use in preclinical stages (t1: p=0.323, t2: p=0.323). AD patients show a significantly increased use of pronouns when reaching early stages of manifest AD (t3: p=0,028). There are no significant correlations between pronoun use and cognitive test-performances at t1 and t2. A higher pronoun use is associated with impaired performance in processing speed (number-connection test: r=0.697; p{\textless}0.05 / Trail Making Test A: r=0.778; p{\textless}0.01) and executive function (Trail Making Test B: r=0.705; p{\textless}0.05) at t3. There is a negative correlation between digit span forward and pronoun use (r=–0.703; p{\textless}0.05). Conclusions Increasing pronoun use seems to be a symptom for early AD. The differences in correlations to cognitive function through time can be explained by reaching a threshold: Cognitive function worsens with conversion to AD and hence the use of pronouns increases. Pronoun use is associated with higher cognitive functions whereas simple short-term memory performance is not. The increasing use of pronouns can be an expression of an impaired ability to adapt language to the listener's needs.},
